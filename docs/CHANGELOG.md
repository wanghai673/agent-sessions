# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

- Added **Open in Codex App** to the session context menu and toolbar. Local Codex threads can be handed to the installed desktop app without a Codex CLI installation. The app must use the same session store; side chats and records without a valid thread ID are excluded. End-to-end desktop navigation remains unverified.

## [5.5] - 2026-09-19

### Features
- **Browse and search DeepSeek Harness history locally.** The read-only source supports v0-v3 plain JSONL and independently framed, checksum-validated Zstandard generations, discovers immutable directory generations, and selects the highest supported generation. A checked-in 58-event v3 catalog gives every known event an explicit tested presentation disposition; unknown required events and failed historical migrations fail closed. Explicit DSH subagents retain hierarchy, while seeded forks remain roots with their fork provenance. Recovered prefixes, incomplete tails, and corrupt artifacts are not published. DSH archive state is ignored, and the source exposes no DSH resume, live activity, quota/cost telemetry, attachment dereferencing, or archive-state mirroring. The decoder uses the vendored official Zstandard 1.5.7 decompression/common sources documented with their BSD license and archive checksum in `ThirdParty/DSHZstd/README.md`. Compatibility evidence comes from checked-in sanitized fixtures, the pinned event catalog, and a local manual UI smoke test; broad real-world coverage remains unverified.

### Improvements
- **Quota Meter scans Codex sessions from the configured root.** Runway discovery now follows the same `SessionsRootOverride`, process-inherited `CODEX_HOME`, and default-path resolution as the session list instead of assuming `~/.codex/sessions`. For a GUI launch that does not inherit a shell-only `CODEX_HOME`, use the Codex sessions-directory override in Preferences.
- **DeepSeek Harness histories retain their intended boundaries.** Seeded v0/v1 migrations carry the rewritten seed boundary forward; Saved archives cannot regress to an older generation when re-starred. Injected plugin context stays out of search, and repaired historical turns no longer show a false trailing interruption.
- **Large session libraries avoid redundant refresh work.** Live-presence lookup caching now retains a bounded large-library working set, and refresh completion no longer rebuilds the session table a second time after the published rows are already applied.
- **Quota Meter's weekly lens now shows the combined burn rate and time left at that pace.** The compact header keeps the weekly reset visible, separates hour and minute units for readability, summarizes projections longer than one day as a whole-hour lower bound, and uses `∞` consistently when Codex has no five-hour limit. Active rates still report measuring, unavailable, or exhausted states; when no session is active, the rate and ETA area stays empty instead of showing a meaningless placeholder.
- **Quota Meter values have more breathing room.** The compact header now clearly separates the remaining weekly percentage from its adjacent burn rate instead of letting values such as `95%` and `4.9%/h` run together.

## [5.4] - 2026-09-16

### Features
- **Cline CLI and Desktop sessions now appear in Agent Sessions.** The app discovers their shared local history, labels the originating surface, searches prompts, responses, thinking, and tool activity, and offers Cline-specific Settings controls. Custom roots are validated before they replace a working location, and partial companion files do not erase an open transcript. Resume, live status, image extraction, hierarchy, and usage tracking are not yet supported.

### Bug Fixes
- **Session retrieval now stays exact and current.** Project filtering distinguishes same-named clones while grouping real Git worktrees with their checkout, active searches refresh when sessions are added or removed without flashing blank, displayed titles are searchable even when the full-text index is stale, Codex fallback titles omit injected context wrappers, and Antigravity cache hydration reconciles confirmed changes and deletions without dropping data when a source root is temporarily unavailable.
- **OpenCode sessions are recognizable before you open them.** Timestamp-only default names now fall back to the session's first user prompt in both current SQLite and legacy JSON storage, while real names and subagent labels keep their existing precedence.
- **Droid session names survive transcript loading and search prewarming.** Full parsing now retains the explicit title already shown by the lightweight list instead of replacing it with the first prompt.
- **OpenClaw source-aware titles stay stable after full parsing.** Telegram origin-plus-prompt labels and tool-name fallbacks no longer regress to raw message envelopes or generic text after search prewarming.
- **Claude prompt titles stay clean after transcript loading.** Full parsing and search prewarming now preserve the same title as the session list instead of exposing local-command Caveat wrappers.

## [5.3] - 2026-09-14

### Highlights
- **Session Info: what a Codex or Claude session contained, beside its transcript.** Press Shift-Command-I or the gauge button to see what the session would cost at published API rates, its tokens split into cached, fresh, and output, the request count, the model and thinking effort, and how turns divided between you, the agent, and tools. Model and effort changes appear as markers in the transcript and as a history that jumps to each one. The price is an estimate, not your plan bill.

### Improvements
- **A calmer main toolbar.** Source filters, search, Quota Meter, Resume, Image Browser, and the transcript and Session Info controls stay in view. Analytics, Reveal in Finder, layout, Reindex, appearance, and Settings moved into the ⋯ menu, and Saved and Archived are now chips inside the search field.
- **The transcript toolbar is one row.** Role filters lead: click one to show only that role, click it again to show everything. The Errors chip shows a count, and view mode moved to the ⋯ menu; Shift-Command-T still cycles modes.
- **Search Sessions also opens with Shift-Command-F**, alongside Option-Command-F.
- **Large and active transcripts stay responsive.** Simple searches inside a large open transcript no longer process the whole file, and a running Codex session reads only its newly added records.
- **The window footer shows a count only while a filter is active**, such as "3,625 of 3,775 shown". Click it to clear the filters.
- **Quota Meter dollar estimates cover more pricing cases:** Claude US-only inference, the original Claude Opus 4 rate, and GPT-5.5 and GPT-5.4 long-context requests.

### Bug Fixes
- **Opening a Codex parent session no longer breaks up its subagent tree.** Subagent counts, row order, selection, and scroll position stay in place while the transcript loads.
- **The Quota Meter weekly burn tooltip is translated in Simplified Chinese.**

<!-- Development history for this release. The release-note generator drops this heading. -->
### Maintenance

- Added the in-app 5.3 What's New card and panel content for Session Info and the calmer toolbar, with English and Simplified Chinese copy.

- Search Sessions now also responds to Shift-Command-F for people accustomed to the cross-app global-search shortcut; Option-Command-F remains available.

- Session info now distinguishes model from thinking effort, retains its compact API-equivalent label while its tooltip explains that the number is an estimate rather than a charge, and preserves four decimal places below one cent. Its token bar reports cached, fresh, and output percentages, retains nonzero sub-percent shares, and exposes those shares to VoiceOver; configuration history appears only after a recorded change; transcript span names its wall-clock meaning; and the header shows when the user last refreshed the analysis. Unavailable weekly-calibration provenance is hidden with the unavailable weekly row.

- Session info no longer shows a Weekly quota row that current Codex transcripts cannot populate: the files do not carry a durable account identity to safely match an individual session to the account-wide weekly calibration.

- Session info gained an Activity section reporting how long the session ran and how its turns divided between you, the agent, and tool calls. Its footer is now just Refresh. Transcript role filters behave like filters elsewhere: clicking one from the everything-shown state narrows to that role, and clicking it again restores everything. The window footer states the session count as "3,625 of 3,775 shown" only while a filter is active, clicking it clears the filters, and the permanent freshness stamp is gone — indexing state still appears while indexing is running.

- Reorganized both toolbars around how often each control is actually used. The main toolbar keeps source filters, search, Quota Meter, Resume, Image Browser, and the transcript and Session info controls; Analytics, Reveal in Finder, layout, Reindex, appearance, and Settings moved into a named overflow menu, and Saved and Archived became scope chips inside the search field. The transcript toolbar is one row instead of two: role filters lead, the Errors chip shows a count when a session has errors, jump arrows appear on the chip being navigated, and view mode moved to the overflow menu while Shift-Command-T continues to cycle modes. Session info now uses a gauge icon, and the inspector shares one surface with the rest of the window chrome so light mode no longer shows a white panel beside a warmer transcript. The Delegated row appears only when a transcript actually records delegated work, and a missing Weekly quota states the reason it is missing rather than suggesting a fix that may not apply.

- Fixed Instant search tokenizing every word of a large open transcript for a simple prefix query. Common one-term searches now scan token boundaries without materializing unrelated tokens and retain the same highlighting semantics, while older index formats remain on the correctness-preserving fresh-parse path. Focused Codex sessions now parse only complete JSONL records appended since the last stable hydration, falling back to a full parse after truncation or file replacement instead of repeatedly rescanning a growing transcript. Transcript-cache rendering is coalesced per session, so rapid appends cannot launch overlapping full-history renders. The active-window presence poll also reuses its Claude Desktop sidecar snapshot for ten seconds instead of walking the full tree every two seconds.

- Fixed the main window doing a full Session info telemetry scan for every opened session even when the inspector was hidden. Hidden inspectors now schedule no telemetry work, obsolete scans stop when selection changes, and Codex and Claude telemetry skip JSON decoding for record types that cannot contain usage or configuration data.

- Fixed Claude Session Runway pricing when transcripts report inference geography as unavailable or empty. These provider states now use published standard rates while explicit US inference keeps its regional multiplier and malformed values still fail closed, restoring real dollar and calibrated weekly burn rates. Live and cached readings from the same Claude account endpoint also share one stable calibration identity, preventing a successful weekly bootstrap from immediately restarting. Because Claude exposes no durable account identity, its bootstrap remains current-process and current-window only instead of being persisted where another account could inherit it.

- Fixed Codex hierarchy rows breaking apart when a session was opened. Tail-first and full transcript hydration now retain the parent's runtime identity and other stable list metadata, so subagent counts, row order, selection, and scroll position stay intact.

- Fixed an intermittent Codex Session Runway refresh loop that alternated between weekly estimates, clocks, `n/a`, and disappearance. OAuth and CLI-RPC now share one authoritative calibration regime, slow scans stop after real scope cancellation, ordinary account-less Codex transcripts can calibrate the live runway without becoming historical account-attribution evidence, and Auto keeps active pending/unavailable rows visible during refresh.

- Added a Session info inspector beside the transcript in both split layouts, with a main-toolbar toggle and Shift-Command-I shortcut. Codex and Claude transcripts show configuration changes inline and expose usage, API-equivalent cost, quota estimates, and unavailable-state reasons for each session independently.

- Session info now leads with API-equivalent cost and shows the session's token split as a single cached/fresh/output bar, so a heavily cached session reads at a glance. Configuration history is a timeline whose rows scroll the transcript to the matching inline change marker, values that were never recorded show an em dash with the reason on hover instead of a sentence, and every estimation detail — pricing basis, price table, manifest, and the five quota calibration fields — collapses into "How this was estimated". The pricing basis groups by model, speed, and region rather than listing one row per request. Inspector labels, legends, history text, accessibility copy, and complete pluralized explanations now resolve through the English and Simplified Chinese catalogs at runtime.

- Transcript telemetry now preserves exact price-manifest provenance, rejects mismatched Codex request components and ambiguous or switched-account evidence, carries cache-write tokens and Claude inference geography through live and weekly accounting, and fails closed on malformed Claude speed/region tiers, unverified model versions, and cache writes without a published rate. Pricing now includes the Claude 4.6+ US inference multiplier, distinct historical Opus 4 rate, Fable/Mythos 5.1 cache reads, and GPT-5.5/GPT-5.4 long-context rates.
- Added the missing Simplified Chinese translation for the weekly burn estimate tooltip.
- Format verification now honors the newest prebump outcome across clean and failed runs, directly tests Claude's bounded usage-page scrolling, and keeps redacted Kimi fixture timestamps from becoming 1970 session dates.
- Corrected the Cursor support surface to Agents Window and CLI sessions; IDE sidepane chats without an Agent transcript remain outside the supported history boundary.

## [5.2] - 2026-09-09

### Highlights
- **Agent Sessions now supports localization, with Simplified Chinese as its first translated language.** The app interface, settings, onboarding, accessibility labels, and permission messages are translated while transcripts, file paths, commands, IDs, and provider names remain unchanged.
- **Want to help bring Agent Sessions to another language?** Contributions are welcome, and no Swift experience is required. See the [localization guide](https://github.com/jazzyalex/agent-sessions/blob/main/docs/localization.md) to get started.

### Bug Fixes
- **Session-list cards take silence and dismissal seriously.** The app waits for every active source to settle, freezes one card per launch, and leaves five quiet days before changing campaigns. Star, translation, and add-an-agent invitations are staggered at 25, 40, and 60 distinct opened sessions. Bounded cards advance only once per launch, × means never ask again, and the wrapping layout preserves full copy and useful accessibility labels at the narrowest width.
- **Quota Meter reads Claude's weekly limit even when plugins push it below the first terminal page.** The `/usage` fallback now walks the bounded view before parsing, so a visible current-session figure no longer hides the all-models weekly window and leaves Claude usage monitoring broken.
- **Quota Meter recognizes Astra sessions.** Added GPT-6 Astra pricing, including cached input, fast mode, and long-context rates, so dollar and calibrated weekly burn no longer show `n/a` solely because the model was unknown.
- **Quota Meter's `Wk` rates no longer turn a short burst or mismatched evidence into a confident weekly rate.** Codex request twins are excluded from cumulative counters, completed sessions remain attributable for five minutes, and oversized records no longer squeeze that history out. Rates require one minute of evidence and decay across five minutes. Calibration is scoped to the current weekly anchor and rejects malformed, incomplete, contradictory, late, or unresolved long-context evidence. Sol requests above 272K input tokens use long-context prices, unknown GPT suffixes fail closed, and the tooltip explains the estimate.
- **Quota Meter keeps its Session Runway rate selector in the toolbar.** Adding the agent-visibility control no longer displaces the Wk/Hr/$/tk selector at the normal window width. The lower-priority font-size shortcut has moved out of the toolbar; Standard and Enlarged remain available in Quota Meter Settings.
- **Quota Meter no longer reconnects forever when Claude account access is unavailable.** A persistent billing response becomes `Claude plan inactive` after 90 seconds, with a one-shot notification and Hide action. Long server-directed limits stay on `rate limited · check plan`, server retry timing wins over stale cold-start work, and permission-only 403 responses still use normal fallbacks. Codex or Claude can also be hidden independently without stopping tracking, menu-bar data, the main-window footer, or indexing.
- **Antigravity and OpenCode keep their intended colors across macOS releases.** Their accents and toolbar pills no longer inherit Apple system palette changes, so the same Agent Sessions build renders consistently on macOS 15 and 26.

<!-- Headings the release-note generator does not recognise are dropped from the
     Sparkle appcast and the GitHub release body (tools/release/sparkle_release_notes.py). -->
### Maintenance
- Aligned the README and product page around finding local agent history, corrected the 15-source capability presentation, replaced the outdated quota animation with current static UI, shortened the README, made the Codex and Claude guides task-first, and added aggregate download/GitHub click events to the existing privacy-first website analytics.
- Steward checks no longer report “All good” or recommend a verified-version bump from stale, thin, discovery-invalid, or scope-none evidence; those inconclusive runs now exit as cannot-check with corrective guidance.
- Steward reports use the same sample statuses for every agent: generated, withheld, unavailable, or disabled. Missing samples no longer imply a privacy rejection or ask contributors to hand-redact records; format differences remain available for maintainer review.
- Added a public social-banner download page with X, Open Graph/GitHub, LinkedIn, and 16:9 variants of the native composition.
- Established the localization foundation with English String Catalogs for app and permission copy, stable non-display identifiers, typed localized-copy boundaries, pluralized session counts, locale-aware notification durations, compiler-extraction drift validation, and contributor conventions for the planned Simplified Chinese translation.
- The telemetry foundation now reads configuration changes and request-level token usage for Codex, Claude, Pi and Copilot, preserves parent-versus-descendant ownership, prices every request against one immutable manifest revision (including long-context tiers), and can attribute API-equivalent session cost to a compatible weekly-quota calibration. Raw quota observations retain reset, precision and source provenance, with account hashes where the provider exposes identity; unavailable calculations fail closed, and no product surface is attached yet.
- Identity-backed session metadata now stores timestamps in seconds consistently while retaining millisecond identity revisions; the in-place migration preserves every indexed row and schedules analytics re-derivation naturally.
- Test runs use a process-local index instead of opening or migrating the user's live database, and the release gate reads combined test totals from the result bundle. The FX steward tool also exports a redacted `session.json` when drift lives in that sidecar.

## [5.1.1] - 2026-08-31

### Highlights
- **A small version number and a big fix list.** Twelve fixes, three of them silent failures you had no way to notice: Claude sessions indexed after 2026-08-21 were listed but returned nothing from search, Claude spend read about a sixth low in the `$` unit, and a `QWEN_HOME` set for something unrelated emptied the Qwen list. All three looked healthy from the outside, which is why they lasted. If you run Claude or Qwen, take this update.

### Features
- **Session Runway can read your week.** A new `Wk` unit answers "how fast is *this* session eating my weekly quota", in percentage points per hour — per session, not one account-wide rate split up. It learns the conversion from usage already on disk, so a figure appears seconds after launch instead of hours later. Idle sessions read `quiet`, which also replaces "flat" in the `5h`, `tk` and `$` units.
- **Claude's model-scoped weekly limit is visible.** Claude reports a third window beside the 5-hour and weekly ones — a weekly budget for one model — and Agent Sessions could not see it at all. The menu-bar dropdown now names it ("Wk Fable: 70% · resets …"); the compact meter's `Wk` stays the all-models number.

### Bug Fixes
- **Claude sessions are searchable again.** Since 2026-08-21 they were listed with the right title, project and dates, but searching their text returned nothing — and nothing said so. 256 sessions on the development machine, nine days' worth. Picked up on the first launch after updating.
- **Claude spend was understated by about a sixth in the `$` unit.** Anthropic charges a cache write by how long it is kept alive — 1.25x input for five minutes, 2x for an hour — and every write was billed at the cheaper rate, while Claude Code almost only writes hour-long ones. Fast mode is priced at its own rates now too, rather than silently at half.
- **A `QWEN_HOME` you set for something else no longer empties your Qwen list.** Qwen 0.14.x ignores that variable and reads `~/.qwen`; the app only ever looked where it pointed. It falls back now, and resume follows the same root — so those sessions come back listed *and* resumable.
- **A Qwen record Agent Sessions does not recognise says so.** Types outside the four it knew were dropped without a trace, so a newer build's transcript could quietly lose turns. They surface as a note now, and the kinds Qwen 0.22 writes render as themselves — including two carrying real conversation.
- **The weekly burn-rate figure is no longer thrown off by a countdown.** When Claude's usage falls back to the terminal, the reset reads "in 4h 28m" rather than a date, and every refresh stored that as a new week — about a third below the truth. Readings are keyed only on a stated date now.
- **Weekly Session Runway drops stale calibration immediately.** A same-process price refresh or weekly-limit shape change can no longer keep serving a conversion learned under the previous scope, and a failed scan from an account you switched away from cannot delay the new account's scan.
- **Copilot sessions carry their real title again.** Copilot writes a multi-line title as a YAML block scalar, so the list read the `|-` indicator as the title. Eight of twelve Copilot sessions on the development machine were listed as `|-`.
- **A custom Antigravity brain directory is actually read.** The sessions-root override reached availability, presence and archive backfill but never the indexer, so a custom path made Antigravity look available while listing nothing. It takes effect on the next refresh instead of the next launch, and Settings now states that the override moves the brain directory only — CLI transcripts always come from `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain`.
- **Analytics counts the same agents the session list does.** Analytics, first-run setup and Settings each carried their own hardcoded idea of which agents start enabled, while the main window worked it out from what is installed — so an installed OpenClaw could count in the list and be left out of Analytics, or Hermes and Cursor count as on without being present.
- **Droid is only on for people who actually run Droid.** It was enabled for everyone, including anyone who has never installed it. It now follows the same rule as every other optional agent: on when detected on disk, off otherwise. A choice you made yourself is kept.
- **Changing a Qwen or fx storage root takes effect on the scan already running.** A refresh started while the previous one was still enumerating could leave that scan reading the old root, so the list settled on whichever finished last.
- **The What's New card stops asking once you have answered it.** It was retired only by its ✕, so reading the notes — or ignoring them — left it armed every launch until the next release, blocking the five other one-time asks queued behind it. Opening the notes retires it, as does leaving it alone for three launches.

<!-- Headings the release-note generator does not recognise are dropped from the
     Sparkle appcast and the GitHub release body (tools/release/sparkle_release_notes.py).
     Entries below are development history, deliberately unannounced. -->
### Maintenance
- Format monitoring: four fixes to the weekly sweep — an OAuth token forwarded into the prebump sandbox for OpenCode, an upstream source registered for fx so the steward rule can fire, and two id- or model-keyed maps opaque-listed before they could leak into a committed fixture. Antigravity 1.1.22 verified against a real session, and the Qwen 0.22.3 source read recorded in the tracker with `max_verified_version` explicitly held at 0.14.3 — reading a writer is not capturing a transcript.
- The test suite runs as its own parallel CI job, and `agents.md` treats the test count as an invariant read from the result bundle rather than parsed out of stdout.
- Registry follow-ups: three duplicated override reads in `PresenceEngine` deleted, `AvailabilityContext.live()` marked unavailable rather than left as an uncached trap for a future adopter, and a dead `@AppStorage` accessor dropped from the Antigravity indexer.
- A DEBUG-only launch argument forces the star and What's New cards on screen so the top slot can be reviewed without hand-editing UserDefaults.
- The docs site gained per-agent history guides, a `/guides/` index, IndexNow submission, and a CI gate blocking root `docs/*.md` leaks and off-site links; one blog post was retracted and republished with a corrected mechanism.

## [5.1] - 2026-08-27

### Highlights
- **Devin CLI and fx join the lineup.** Two more coding agents put their local history in the same searchable list as the rest, each with a Settings pane and a resume command. Both were contributed and are stewarded by @thedavidweng — the first outside test of the adapter recipe 5.0 documented.

### Features
- **Devin CLI sessions.** Browsing, search, filtering, Analytics and transcripts over Devin's shared SQLite store, with binary and storage-root controls in Settings. `devin --resume <id>`, verified on CLI 3000.5.20 ([report](https://github.com/jazzyalex/agent-sessions/issues/62#issuecomment-5433779336)). Active sessions only; no image extraction yet.
- **fx (vercel-labs) sessions.** Per-session checkpoints under `~/.fx/sessions`, with every kind of turn rendered — background commands, auto-compaction summaries, interrupted turns. `fx --resume <id>`, verified on fx 0.0.5 ([report](https://github.com/jazzyalex/agent-sessions/issues/62#issuecomment-5433779336)). No image extraction yet.

### Bug Fixes
- **Weekly Session Runway reflects recent quota movement.** Its `%/h` averaged everything burned since the weekly reset, so one heavy day set the pace for days; it measures the burn between recent same-reset readings now, and shows `tk/h` until it has one.

## [5.0.2] - 2026-08-22

### Bug Fixes
- **OpenCode and Copilot sessions carry their own ID again.** OpenCode moved to a single shared `opencode.db`, and the transcript toolbar still read the ID off the file path — so every OpenCode session called itself "code" and Copy Session ID handed you `opencode`. Both now read the session's own id.
- **A live OpenCode or Hermes session keeps growing while you watch it.** Their freshness check looked at the database file's timestamp, but SQLite writes land in the `-wal` sidecar first, so a transcript you had open froze at whatever it held when you selected it. Cursor was checked the same way.
- **Subagent reports read as text, not as an envelope.** An OpenCode `task`, a Hermes `delegate_task` and a Qwen tool result each arrive wrapped — raw `<task_result>` XML or a one-key JSON blob — and the transcript rendered the wrapper. The report itself is shown now, with the child session's id on the OpenCode card. Sessions indexed before this update pick it up when they are next re-read.
- **Copy Session ID on an OpenClaw session pastes the id.** It came with the `openclaw:<agent>:` prefix Agent Sessions uses to keep its agents apart, which nothing outside the app accepts.
- **Pi subagent runs nest under the session that spawned them.** Pi records the parent id with the transcript filename's timestamp still on the front, so the match never landed and subagents sat at the top level.

### Improvements
- **Cursor stops re-reading its database on every refresh.** Sessions that live only in `store.db` were being run through the JSONL transcript parser on each pass, which could never find anything there.

<!-- Headings the release-note generator does not recognise are dropped from the
     Sparkle appcast and the GitHub release body (tools/release/sparkle_release_notes.py).
     Entries below are development history, deliberately unannounced. -->
### Maintenance
- The session list can ask a long-time user to steward an agent that has no one watching its format, prefilled with an agent their own history shows they run. Same spent-once lifecycle as the other asks in that slot: quiet until the next release, retired after three rounds, never on a fresh install, and only the agent's name ever leaves the Mac. The card's buttons also stopped squeezing its text at the narrowest window width, and a DEBUG-only launch argument (`-AgentSessionsDebugTopSlotCard`) forces one of these cards on screen so it can be reviewed without hand-editing UserDefaults.
- `SessionArchiveManager.pin` and the pinned-session sync loop now honour a source that declares `archive: nil`, which previously only gated the two backfill resolvers — a shared-database source would have had its whole store copied per starred session. Inert for all thirteen shipping sources; found while reviewing PR #56.
- Weekly format sweep for 2026-08-21: five drifts closed, seven agent versions bumped, the Grok version tests decoupled from the live matrix, and Gemini CLI dropped from the format-check tooling.

## [5.0.1] - 2026-08-18

### Bug Fixes
- **Resume works when you launch the app from Finder.** Pi, Kimi Code and Qwen Code ship as `#!/usr/bin/env node` scripts, and Finder hands the app a PATH with no Homebrew in it, so the probe died before the CLI ever ran and the app decided the CLI had no resume flags. Grok CLI is native and never hit that, but cached the same dead verdict. All four now probe with your login shell's PATH, and a probe that could not run is no longer mistaken for a CLI without features. ([#58](https://github.com/jazzyalex/agent-sessions/issues/58))
- **Node version managers no longer hide your CLI.** Probes read nvm's and fnm's default alias straight from disk, so an rc file that only loads them in a real terminal is no longer a dead end.
- **Qwen takes a second look at a custom binary.** A failed probe could record "supports nothing" against a path you picked yourself, and nothing ever retried it. That verdict is dropped and re-probed at launch.
- **Codex sessions keep their origin.** Search indexing overwrote it on every pass, so Desktop sessions wore a `cli` pill and could change label as they finished loading. Existing libraries repair themselves once on upgrade.
- **Codex CLI and `codex exec` sessions stop claiming to be Desktop.** Recent Codex builds stamp every session "Codex Desktop", so the surface now comes from the session's own `source` instead.
- **Side chats say "side" and inherit their parent's origin.** They claimed Desktop before, whatever they actually branched from.

## [5.0] - 2026-08-17

### Highlights
- **Agents are plug-in adapters now.** Each agent used to be hand-wired into every surface — list, search, pills, Analytics, Settings — so it could show up in one and be missing from another. Now an agent is described once and every surface reads that description. Adding one dropped from 26 shared-file edits to 12, each listed in [the guide](https://github.com/jazzyalex/agent-sessions/blob/main/docs/adding-a-session-source.md) with a test that fails if you miss it. Bring the agent you use.
- **Qwen Code is the thirteenth agent.** Local Qwen chats land in browsing, search, Analytics and the transcript view — reasoning, tool calls, and rewound branches reconstructed along the active parent chain. Active chats resume in the CLI; archived ones stay browse-only. Format verified against real 0.14.3 transcripts (newer builds wait on a Qwen account — the free tier is gone).

### Features
- **The app asks for help adding your agent — once.** A dismissible card points long-time users at the proposal form and contributing guide. It shows up late, takes no for an answer, and reads and sends nothing.

### Bug Fixes
- **Disabled agents no longer sneak into filter-view search results.** The search allow-list was hand-written and stopped short of several agents; it now derives from the same enablement everything else reads.
- **Kimi Code and Grok CLI now report when loading finishes.** Their indexing never reached the launch state, so startup progress could sit incomplete while their sessions were ready. All thirteen agents report now; ones you don't have settle to ready.
- **OpenClaw no longer marks Analytics stale on every launch.** Its enable switch had a shadow copy that never agreed with the original; there is one setting now.
- **Every agent's on/off switch flashes the same restart notice.** Five agents used to skip it silently.
- **OpenCode and Hermes transcripts are searchable.** Their SQLite-backed sessions shared one file path, so search ingest couldn't tell them apart and skipped their text. Sessions are tracked by identity now, WAL-only changes included.

### Documentation
- **A written path for adding coding agents.** Propose a source, send sanitized format evidence, or hand the repo's brief to your own coding agent. A per-agent steward program keeps shipped formats verified as CLIs move.

<!-- Headings the release-note generator does not recognise are dropped from the
     Sparkle appcast and the GitHub release body (tools/release/sparkle_release_notes.py).
     Entries below are development history, deliberately unannounced. -->
### Maintenance
- Format monitoring gained a Grok prebump driver, lifting Grok to `supports_latest`, and the weekly format check gained a value pass and an install-then-session bump rule. The matrix-key map is single-sourced, and Qwen is registered in the monitored set (11 → 12 agents).
- `scripts/steward_check.py` lets a steward check one agent's local sessions against the recorded format baseline with a single command; on drift it produces a redacted sample (withheld entirely if the leak scan finds anything) and a ready-to-paste issue body. Own test suite.
- The session-source registry ships with test sentinels pinning registry order, the provider catalog, the full UserDefaults key table, transcript hosting, Analytics participation, the Preferences sidebar, and the search allow-list.

## [4.8] - 2026-08-14

### Highlights
- **Grok CLI is the eleventh current agent source Agent Sessions reads.** Its sessions land in the session list, in search, in Analytics and in the Image Browser, with tool calls, reasoning and assistant output rendered in the transcript, a filter pill in the toolbar, and both Copy Resume Command and terminal resume. Agent Sessions switches it on when it finds Grok CLI on your Mac, and Settings → Agents gains a Grok CLI pane for the binary path and storage root. Subagent runs are shown under the session that spawned them — Grok records that parentage in the parent's own tree, so `grok sessions list` does not show them at all. Schema verified against 141 real sessions. Contributed by [@thedavidweng](https://github.com/thedavidweng) in [#55](https://github.com/jazzyalex/agent-sessions/pull/55).

### Features
- **Analytics counts every agent you have enabled.** The rollup ran on a hand-written list of sources, and Cursor and OpenClaw were never on it — their sessions were indexed, searchable and visible in the list, but contributed nothing to any total, chart or project breakdown, and nothing reported the gap. Analytics now derives from the full set of sources, so every agent counts and a new one cannot be forgotten. Cursor also gains the agent-picker entry it never had. Existing installs rebuild their analytics once on the next launch to pick up the two missing sources; it reads the session index and touches no files.

### Bug Fixes
- **An unrelated binary earlier in your PATH no longer masks the real CLI.** Cursor, Kimi and Pi searched candidate locations group by group and returned the first executable they found, even when it did not advertise the flags the CLI needs — so a same-named binary in the login shell's PATH won before the actual install directory was ever examined, reporting its version as the agent's and refusing resume outright. Each now searches one ordered list, and a binary that advertises the right flags always wins.
- **Analytics no longer reports "no sources enabled" over data it has.** Its empty state, the banner warning that totals exclude an agent, and the agent picker were three more hand-written lists, each stopping at a different source. With Cursor or OpenClaw as your only enabled agent, Analytics claimed nothing was enabled while showing that agent's data, and the picker could not isolate either. All three lists now derive from one source of truth.
- **The Image Browser credits the prompt that produced an image, not the scaffolding around it.** Agents inject housekeeping blocks into the conversation as if they were your messages — an AGENTS.md preamble, `<environment_context>`, a `<system-reminder>`. The transcript already knew to look past those when deciding which prompt an image belongs to; the Image Browser did not, so an image could be filed under a `<system-reminder>` there while the transcript filed the same image under the real prompt. Claude injects those blocks mid-conversation, so this was not limited to the opening of a session. Both now agree.
- **"Live sessions only" includes Claude Desktop chats.** Claude Desktop sessions have no terminal process for the usual live probes to find, so the filter could hide running Claude chats even though the Quota Meter saw their runway rows. The live session engine now synthesizes Claude Desktop presences from the same runway identities, preserving active/idle state and avoiding duplicates when a transcript is already claimed by another probe. The approach — Claude Desktop chats as first-class live presences — came from @Krazycatt in [#51](https://github.com/jazzyalex/agent-sessions/pull/51); my thanks.
- **The Session Runway switches units immediately.** Selecting Wk could leave the previous tokens-per-hour values visible while the asynchronous runway scan recalculated, and an automatic fallback after a quota window appeared or disappeared had the same problem. Rows now change to the effective unit at once and show a waiting value until recalculation finishes.
- **Codex plan upgrades recover without a relaunch or unnecessary sign-in.** If you hit the weekly limit and then upgrade your plan, the running app can still hold its old failed-fetch cooldown and claim the saved login needs attention even though it remains valid. Agent Sessions now clears that process-local state and retries silently before showing **Fix…**; it only recommends `codex login` when the clean retry also rejects the saved credentials.

## [4.7] - 2026-08-04

### Highlights
- **Kimi Code is the tenth current agent source Agent Sessions reads.** Its sessions land in the session list, in search and in Analytics, with tool calls and assistant output rendered in the transcript, a filter pill in the toolbar, and both Copy Resume Command and terminal resume. Agent Sessions switches it on when it finds Kimi Code on your Mac, and Settings → Agents gains a Kimi Code pane for the binary path and storage root.
- **Active Claude cloud sessions appear in the Quota Meter.** Sessions running on Anthropic's infrastructure were invisible outside Claude Desktop; they now sit in the pinned Quota Meter beside your local agents, marked **Cloud** and ordered above them. They carry no burn rate — there is no local transcript to measure — so they report status instead of a runway. Off by default, and offered only once you have saved a claude.ai cookie under Settings → Usage Tracking, since the fetch depends on it.

### Features
- **Agent runs with no terminal now reach the Quota Meter.** A `claude -p` run started by launchd, a shell script, or another app has no controlling terminal, and presence discovery required one — so those sessions never appeared in Live Sessions even though the main window indexed their transcripts normally. They are picked up now.
- **Analytics counts Pi sessions.** Pi has been a supported source since 3.8 but was missing from the analytics rollups. Its sessions, messages, durations and projects are now included, with a Pi-only filter alongside the others.

### Bug Fixes
- **Pi and Cursor sessions get their working directory back.** After a full parse, a Pi or Cursor session lost the directory it ran in. Two things broke as a result: its resume command came back without the `cd`, so the resumed agent started wherever your terminal happened to point, and the search index stored no path for it at all, so filtering by project silently stopped matching those sessions. Both are fixed, and sessions indexed before the fix are re-read once in the background after you update, so the repair reaches the history you already have rather than only new sessions.
- **A resume that fails now tells you.** Every reason a resume could fail — a CLI that could not be found, a Warp that refused to launch, a session whose working directory is unknown — produced an error nothing ever displayed, so all of them looked identical on screen: nothing happened. Failures now come back as an alert. Warp in particular used to report success even when it never opened, and a failed launch would quietly retry a different command that could resume an entirely different session while reporting the one you clicked.
- **Checking an agent's CLI no longer freezes the window.** Probing a binary spawns a login shell and a `--help` for each candidate path, and eight of the agent coordinators ran that on the main thread with no timeout — so a slow shell profile or an unresponsive binary hung the whole app until it finished. Probes now run off the main thread.
- **The Codex meter no longer sits on "reconnecting…" forever.** With no Codex CLI run in the previous two days, the background refresh returned before ever making its live usage call — so whenever Agent Sessions was not the frontmost app the meter stayed on "reconnecting…" indefinitely, and only recovered if you focused the window. The live fetch no longer depends on a recent local session file. And when a fetch genuinely comes back empty, the meter now says **no active session** rather than implying a connection it is still waiting on.
- **Codex sessions containing an auto-review turn reappear in the dollar view.** Codex bills real tokens for its `codex-auto-review` model, but no price key matched it — and an unpriceable slice makes the whole session unpriceable, so the runway dropped those sessions from the $ view entirely and fell back to tokens per hour without saying why. The model is priced now.
- **Antigravity code edits and web searches read as tool work again.** `CODE_ACTION` and `SEARCH_WEB` carry the same result envelope as the file and command events, but fell through to the parser's default branch and rendered as system noise — a code edit was indistinguishable from a checkpoint. Transcripts the CLI truncated upstream are also marked as such now, instead of rendering as though they were complete.

### Improvements
- **Turning an agent on or off updates the rest of the app.** Agent Sessions only watched five of the eleven agent switches, so toggling any of the other six left Analytics and the usage meters running on the previous set until relaunch.
- **A refused Copy Resume Command leaves your clipboard alone.** It cleared the pasteboard before working out whether it had anything to write, so the cases where it declines — a Codex session whose id cannot be resolved, a session with no known working directory — wiped whatever you were holding and replaced it with nothing.

### Not in Release Notes
- The session list can now ask you, once, to star the project on GitHub. It waits until you have opened 25 sessions or kept the app for 30 days, never appears on a first run, and offers "Maybe later" (one retry two weeks on) alongside a permanent dismiss. Starring or dismissing retires it for good, and ignoring it does too — three launches without an answer end a round the same way "Maybe later" would, so it can appear at most six times whatever you do. No network call and nothing recorded beyond the local choice.

## [4.6.4] - 2026-07-21

### Highlights
- **Compact and Full Agent Cockpit are retired; the Quota Meter is the only mode.** The two larger cockpit modes carried a session list, search, By Project grouping and filter pills that duplicated what the main window already does better, so they are gone and the Quota Meter absorbs what people actually used it for. If you last quit in Compact or Full, you land on the Quota Meter — no setting to restore, nothing to reconfigure, and the old modes' leftover preferences and window positions are cleared for you on launch. Where you put the Quota Meter is untouched.
- **Two keyboard shortcuts change.** **⇧⌘M** ("Cycle Cockpit View") is gone — cycling means nothing with one mode. **⌘⌥⇧C** now shows and hides the Quota Meter, where it used to select the mode and bring the window forward; pressing it while the Quota Meter is on screen hides it.
- **The View menu is a single Quota Meter toggle**, replacing the three-mode submenu, and **Settings → Agent Cockpit is now Settings → Quota Meter** — its Compact Mode and Full Mode sections go with the modes they configured.
- **Gone with the modes:** the session search field and ⌘K, By Project grouping, the All/Active/Idle filter pills, ⌘1–9 and ⌘0 row focus, the row context menu, the full-mode toolbar row, and the Full/Compact quota footer with its hover drawer. The Quota Meter keeps its provider limit rows, Session Runway drawer, chrome modes, pin, enlarged text, the runway and probe popovers, the open-app and settings buttons, and ⌘W.

### Bug Fixes
- **The Quota Meter's text-size button no longer disappears when you switch to Standard.** Standard text makes the window about 30pt narrower, and the toolbar used to shed that button first — hiding the only control that switches back to Enlarged, so the setting was one-way from inside the window. The toolbar now narrows before it drops anything: the Session Runway control gives up its presentation half first, and every button stays put.

## [4.6.3] - 2026-07-20

### Highlights
- **You can switch the footer usage meters off, and it works now.** Settings → Usage Tracking had three toggles for this — Show Codex strip, Show Claude strip, Show reset times — and every one of them was inert: they saved a value nothing read, and flipping usage tracking quietly overwrote whatever you'd chosen. They're replaced by a single **Show usage in the footer** switch that genuinely hides the meters from the main window, straight away, without a relaunch. Usage tracking keeps running while it's off, so the menu bar and the Quota Meter carry on as before — this only decides whether the main window shows the same numbers a second time. Reset times no longer have a toggle at all; they're part of reading a meter, so the footer always shows them (the menu bar keeps its own reset-indicator switches in its own menu).

### Bug Fixes
- **The usage-source note stops breaking the footer layout.** When a reading came from the claude.ai web path or the CLI probe rather than the provider's usual source, the footer tagged it on a second line stacked under the meter — which grew the fixed-height strip and shoved the rest of the footer out of line. The tag now sits beside the meter and the strip stays one row. This affected the **via CLI probe** tag exactly as much as **via claude.ai**; both now share one label mapping.

## [4.6.2] - 2026-07-20

### Highlights
- **Your Codex history rebuilds once, on the first launch after updating.** The guardian fix below can only reach sessions that are already indexed by re-reading them, so this release re-derives the metadata for your Codex sessions on first launch. While that runs, Codex sessions are missing from the session list **and from search results**, then reappear all at once when it finishes — there's no partial fill. A large library takes a while: timed here at about **two and a half minutes** for 3,300 Codex sessions across 5 GB of transcripts, and proportionally less for smaller histories. Claude sessions are untouched throughout, and the rebuild happens exactly once. If your Codex sessions look like they've vanished right after updating, let it finish.

### Features
- **Cowork sessions are labelled as Cowork.** Claude's Cowork tasks were already in your history, but they wore the same **desk** badge as Claude Desktop's Code tab, so there was no way to tell a sandboxed Cowork run from a normal desktop coding session. They now carry their own **cowork** badge. Renaming a task inside Cowork retitles it here without a reindex, and archiving one puts it behind the same archive filter that already covers Claude Desktop — the transcript's archive strip included.
- **Codex's sandboxed tasks get their own badge too.** Codex Desktop runs some tasks in a throwaway workspace under `~/Documents/Codex/<date>/<slug>/` instead of a repo you chose. Those sessions used to look identical to ordinary Codex Desktop work; they now carry a **work** badge, named after Codex's own `codex_work_desktop` marker rather than borrowing Claude's Cowork name for a different vendor's feature.

### Bug Fixes
- **Codex guardian sessions stop duplicating their parent's row.** Codex's approval-reviewer subagent ("guardian") sessions used to show up as a second top-level row right next to the session they were reviewing — same title, the same **work** pill, no sign the two were related. They're now classified as subagents like any other Codex subagent: they nest underneath their parent, and the **work** pill no longer duplicates onto them. Applying this to sessions you already indexed needs the one-time Codex rebuild described under Highlights.
- **Resuming a Codex guardian session no longer resumes its parent.** Newer Codex builds recorded a guardian subagent's session id as its parent's rather than its own, so clicking Resume on a guardian row reopened the parent's session. Guardian rows now resume themselves.
- **Claude usage recovers in seconds, not minutes.** When the Claude CLI refreshes its sign-in while Agent Sessions holds an older cached token, the meter now retries immediately with the fresh token instead of waiting out a multi-minute credential check.
- **Rate-limit windows no longer black out the meter.** When Anthropic's usage endpoint rate-limits (windows can run tens of minutes), Agent Sessions now switches to the claude.ai web path to keep live numbers flowing instead of sitting on stale data.
- **The spinner tells you why.** The "reconnecting…" cells in the Quota Meter, menu bar, and footer now say what's actually happening — "rate limited — retrying…" — instead of spinning anonymously.
- **Leaked probe sessions are reaped reliably.** A hidden Claude probe could survive for days if its tmux socket vanished; the launch sweep now retries and logs instead of silently skipping.
- **Subagents spawned by subagents no longer vanish from the list.** When a subagent had children of its own — a Codex `review` subagent that spawned thread children, for instance — those grandchildren were dropped from the session list entirely: not nested, not shown at top level, just absent. The list now walks the whole tree, so every session appears under its own parent at its own indent level, and collapsing a row hides everything beneath it.
- **Surface badges stop getting clipped on subagent rows.** Subagent rows spend part of the Agent column on their indent, which was enough to cut a six-character badge down to `cowo…`. Badges now always render whole.

## [4.6.1] - 2026-07-19

### Highlights
- **The Quota Meter stops claiming "no active session" while it's holding fresh data.** Once your Claude CLI token lapsed, the calm "idle" verdict latched — and successful web-fallback reads could never clear it. The meter insisted nothing was running while the pasted-cookie web path served fresh usage every minute. Fresh live data now outranks the idle latch (a genuine auth problem still wins), Claude's idle tooltip becomes a recovery ladder — run the CLI, paste a cookie, probe — and web-served numbers are tagged **via claude.ai** so you can see where the reading came from.

### Features
- **Ask for a fresh usage reading from the toolbar.** Forcing a hard probe used to be an undiscoverable double-click on the Quota Meter. It's now a visible toolbar button with a per-provider menu that tells you in the row itself when a probe is **probing…** or has **failed**, greys out providers it can't probe with a reason, and won't let two probes race from the toolbar, Preferences, and the usage strip at once. The old double-click gesture is gone.

### Bug Fixes
- **Burn rate no longer overstates subagent-heavy sessions.** A session that keeps spawning subagents also keeps spawning fresh transcript paths, and each new path's first turn — a couple of seconds of cache-heavy setup — read as thousands of tokens per second. The existing session-level cap never fired for these sessions, because some path was always already measured, so orchestrated fleets showed burn rates up to 3.6x too high (1.6x median, validated against live ground truth). Provisional paths are now clamped to the session's best measured path rate, with pricing components scaled by the same factor — median error drops to roughly 1.25x.

## [4.6] - 2026-07-16

### Highlights
- **Read your Claude subscription usage without the CLI — paste a session cookie.** If you don't run the Claude CLI, Agent Sessions reads usage over the web instead. On macOS 14+ Safari stopped handing the claude.ai session to other apps, so that path had quietly become a dead end. Now you paste your claude.ai session cookie once in Settings → Usage Tracking: it's kept in your Keychain, needs no Full Disk Access, and sign-in never leaves your browser. A **Test now** button confirms it works on the spot.

### Features
- **Paste-a-cookie web usage for Claude.** Settings → Usage Tracking accepts your claude.ai `sessionKey` (or the whole cookie header) and uses it directly for usage lookups — no Full Disk Access, no scraping. The app only holds the token you hand it, stored in the Keychain. Reading the cookie from Safari is kept as a legacy fallback for anyone it still works for.

### Bug Fixes
- **The Web API path stops telling signed-in users to "sign in".** When it couldn't find a claude.ai session it advised signing in "at claude.ai (default profile)" — impossible to satisfy on macOS 14/15, where Safari keeps the live cookie in a store apps can't read. The messages are now honest and cause-aware, and point to the fix that actually works: paste your session cookie.

### Improvements
- **The Quota Meter's right-click hint stays findable.** In On-Demand mode the "Right-click for controls" hint used to show once and never again — but right-click is the only way back to the toolbar, so it now reappears on every hover.
- **The agent row shows which runway lens is live.** A subtle marker under the 5h or Wk symbol tracks the runway toggle, so you can tell at a glance what the burn rate is measuring.

## [4.5] - 2026-07-15

### Highlights
- **See what each session is costing you.** The Session Runway can now report every active session's **API-equivalent spend per hour** — `$4.20/h` — priced per model, so an orchestrator on Opus driving subagents on Sonnet is costed at what each one actually runs at, not blended. Pick what the runway measures right from the meter: **5-hour** burn, **weekly** share, raw **tokens/hour**, or **dollars**.
- **The Quota Meter holds still.** It used to grow whenever your pointer crossed it, which made a pinned widget a fight to reposition — the window moved while you were aiming at it. Now the pointer only moves it, and **right-click** brings up its controls. Drag it anywhere; it stays exactly where you put it.

### Features
- **Selectable Session Runway rates.** 5-Hour, Weekly, Tokens, or Dollars — chosen from the runway control in the Quota Meter toolbar, and remembered. Dollars falls back to token throughput for any model we can't price, rather than dropping the session.
- **One View-menu entry for the cockpit.** `View → Quota Meter / Agent Cockpit` now holds the whole choice — Quota Meter, Compact, Full, or **Off** — with ⌘⌥⇧C for the Quota Meter and ⇧⌘M to cycle.
- **The Quota Meter offers itself.** If you have Codex or Claude sessions but have never switched it on, a card in the session list explains what it does and turns it on in one click. Fresh installs now arrive with it enabled.

### Bug Fixes
- **The Quota Meter no longer walks up the screen.** Near the bottom of a display it grew *upward* when its toolbar appeared, but collapsing kept the raised top edge — so it climbed one toolbar height every time, drifting away from where you parked it.
- **Compact and the Quota Meter can be closed.** Neither has a titlebar close button, and ⌘W merely beeped, so the only way out was switching to Full or quitting. ⌘W now closes them, as does `View → … → Off`.
- **The cockpit's provider rows line up with their reset-credits line.** The 5h/Wk row sat centered while the credits line beneath it was flush left.

### Improvements
- The Quota Meter toolbar is grouped by what its controls do — window destinations lead, the two runway controls fuse into one segmented pill, and pin stands alone behind a separator.

## [4.4] - 2026-07-13

### Highlights
- **Codex usage keeps working when OpenAI pauses the 5-hour limit.** OpenAI temporarily removed Codex's 5-hour rate-limit window (it's gone from the Codex app too), which left the Quota Meter mislabeling your weekly usage as "5h" with the wrong reset. Agent Sessions now detects this automatically: the 5h line reads a calm **"no limit"**, your **weekly** usage stays accurate, and everything snaps back on its own if OpenAI restores the 5h window.
- **An honest Session Runway for Codex.** With no 5-hour budget to measure against, each active Codex session now shows its real **token throughput** (e.g. `412K tk/h`) instead of a burn rate scaled to the wrong window — a true, comparable read of what's burning right now. It returns to the familiar 5h "m/h" once the window is back.

### Bug Fixes
- New **format guardrail**: if a provider changes its usage data in a way Agent Sessions can't confidently interpret, the meter now shows a clear **"can't verify"** instead of displaying a wrong number.

## [4.3.2] - 2026-07-12
### Highlights
- **A much quieter Quota Meter.** The usage meters were re-reading and re-parsing your entire session history every few seconds while idle. They now cache each file's parse, cutting idle CPU from roughly 25–41% down to about 11% (measured on Release) so your machine stays cool and quiet. The "active burn" shimmer also pauses when nothing is burning and honors **Reduce Motion**.

### Bug Fixes
- Claude usage over the **Web API** path is far more resilient: when Full Disk Access isn't granted it now shows a clear cause instead of failing silently, retries recover instead of stalling after a few failures, and a new **Test Web API** button in Preferences → Usage Tracking runs an end-to-end self-check.
- An **idle, expired Claude token** now shows a calm "no active session" state instead of a misleading error.

## [4.3.1] - 2026-07-10
### Highlights
- **A rebuilt first run.** The setup experience is now a single, focused screen — live session count, per-agent toggles, and the Quota Meter always in view — plus a **What's New** panel that surfaces changes when you update and in-app **feedback** you can send without leaving the app.
- **One-click "Fix" for usage tracking.** When Agent Sessions can't read your Claude or Codex usage — an expired login or a signed-out CLI — every usage surface (menu bar, cockpit meter, window footer) now shows a **Fix…** button that opens a guided dialog: it explains what's wrong and walks you through the solutions in order (re-authenticate → Web API or CLI-probe fallback → recheck), so you're never stuck at a broken meter.

### Bug Fixes
- Expired Claude no longer shows a misleading **"0%"** — the Quota Meter, menu bar, and cockpit now show an honest "reconnecting" state and then a clear "sign-in needed" prompt instead of reading as quota-exhausted.
- Usage returns after `claude auth login` **without relaunching** — on the next refresh, or on its own within ~30 seconds.
- The "session expired" sign-in prompt now appears **promptly** (~90 seconds) instead of after several minutes of silent "reconnecting."
- The Quota Meter / Runway **"active burn"** countdown no longer lingers after a session goes idle — it clears shortly after you stop.
- Runway **"+N sessions"** overflow now counts hidden idle sessions, and a lone hidden session is promoted to a real row instead of "+1."
- Sessions with **non-ASCII (multi-byte) transcripts** are no longer hidden by a too-strict decode.
- **Settings** opens to the requested pane even when the window is already open.

### Improvements
- Cleaner window footer — the usage strip drops its grey background bar.

## [4.3] - 2026-07-09
### Highlights
- **Usage tracking that never cries wolf.** When your Claude or Codex CLI is signed out — or its saved token has quietly expired — the Quota Meter and Session Runway no longer flash false alarms or silently pop open a browser sign-in behind your back. Agent Sessions now reads the real CLI auth state, degrades calmly (a quiet "signed out" state instead of a scary error), and shows clear in-app **sign-in remediation** right in the usage strips and menu bar so you know exactly how to get your quota readings back.

### Runway auth — graceful degradation & guided CLI fallback (P1–P4)
- **Cold-start fallback fix (P1):** on a fresh launch with no cached snapshot, a transient first-poll OAuth miss (e.g. the Keychain read racing app launch) no longer immediately spawns the interactive tmux `/usage` probe — which could open a Safari OAuth sign-in for an already-signed-in user. The fallback is deferred through the 90s cold-start window while the healthy OAuth path retries; the Keychain read also retries once on a transient `.unreadable`.
- **Cause-aware degradation (P2):** transient failures (5xx / network / 429) show a calm "temporarily unavailable — retrying" caption in the strip, menu bar, and Cockpit instead of the alarming banner, and clear on the next good fetch. A verified 401 flips the internal `.expired` verdict immediately (preserving tmux-suppression) but the published banner is debounced behind a 5-minute clock, so a brief blip stays calm and only a persistent 401 escalates.
- **No-CLI remediation ladder (P3):** a Claude user without the CLI now gets a two-rung fix-it ladder — rung 1 enables the existing claude.ai Web API mode (no install), rung 2 guides a CLI install — instead of a `claude auth login` command they can't run. AS never mints a token or runs an installer; the cancelled "sign in to Agent Sessions directly" copy is removed.
- **Probe hardening (P4):** the tmux `/usage` script checks for an auth/login screen before pressing any keys and suppresses the browser hook (`BROWSER=/usr/bin/true`), so a probe can never advance a login into the browser; suppressed/aborted probes now raise the auth banner instead of failing silently; CLI-probe data is labeled "via CLI probe"; and the interactive Auto-mode fallback is now **opt-in** (Preferences → Usage, default off — behavior change).
- Agent Sessions will not mint or refresh its own Claude subscription token (no in-app OAuth login) — it remains a read-only usage reader.

### Auth verdict plumbing & hardening (tracks A–C)
- Shared `UsageAuthStatus` model and remediation copy; both the Claude and Codex usage managers publish an authoritative auth verdict from an explicit `claude auth status` / `codex login status` probe (throttled to ~15 min on the success path) rather than inferring it from a fetch failure.
- Result-typed credential resolution surfaces 401 / absent / malformed distinctly, distinguishes Keychain not-found from unreadable, and short-circuits the usage feed while signed out. Debounced classifiers on both providers never false-alarm; recovery emits cleanly.
- Closed several probe hazards found during hardening: cold-start tmux hangs, probe reentrancy, orphaned live tmux probes (SIGKILL-escalate past the retry cap), and spawning a `/status` or `/usage` tmux probe while signed out. A permission-gated one-shot "signed out" notification fires at most once.
- Non-interactive, browser-safe delegated token refresh; cold-start tmux fallback deferred so a valid-token relaunch never opens browser auth.

### Improvements
- Quota Meter: a segmented cockpit-view popover that matches the Runway drawer styling, and the ⇧⌘M shortcut now cycles cockpit views. Auth remediation renders in the usage strips and menu bar (`AuthRemediationBanner`).
- Transcript: unified color palette and a native macOS list/transcript separator, with shared layout tokens for a calmer, more consistent look. Removed dead `ClaudeUsageStripView`.
- Usage probing is gentler on your machine — auth-status re-checks are throttled on the healthy path, and stale background probes are cleaned up instead of piling up.

### Bug Fixes
- Session view: restored visible click-and-drag text selection in the Rich Session transcript.
- Filter: archived Codex sessions now appear in the Archived filter regardless of (often NULL) surface metadata — the filter keys off file path instead.

## [4.2] - 2026-07-06
### Highlights
- **A brand-new transcript.** The session transcript is rebuilt as a clean, readable **Session view** — structured message cards instead of a raw terminal dump. Assistant replies render as real Markdown (headings, lists, GFM tables, fenced code blocks, blockquotes, inline code), tool calls fold into tidy cards you can expand, and inline images and review summaries appear inline. File paths are clickable — click one to open it in your editor — and every turn and tool call shows a duration badge so you can see where the time went.
- **Filter and navigate a session.** Focus the transcript on just **You**, **Agent**, **Tools**, or **Errors**, and use the ▲▼ controls beside each to jump to the next or previous occurrence. Right-click any message for **Copy**, **Copy Block**, or **Speak**.

### Improvements
- Quota Meter now **smiles** when your current pace is on track to fit within the 5-hour window.

### Bug Fixes
- Search: fixed a rare crash while the full-text search index was building in the background.

## [4.1] - 2026-07-03
### Highlights
- **The Instant release.** This release is a top-to-bottom performance program: transcripts open instantly, sorting is instant, search is indexed, scrolling is smooth, and the app is dramatically quieter when idle.
- **Transcripts open instantly** — even monster sessions. Opening a session paints the newest content immediately and completes the rest in the background; the multi-second (sometimes 30s+) beachball on large histories is gone. Jumping to older content (search hits, deep links, first prompt) loads the needed portion on demand.
- **Instant sort and smoother lists** — clicking a sort column re-orders in place instead of re-running the whole pipeline (~7s → ~0.5s on large histories), fast scrolling no longer stutters, and scrubbing the list no longer stalls the transcript or the HUD.
- **Indexed full-text search** — the search corpus is now ingested into the SQLite FTS index in the background, so searches hit the index instead of re-scanning files; recently-changed sessions are still scanned live so results are never stale. Selecting a result from a search-filtered list auto-jumps to the first match.
- **Quieter when idle** — live-session probing, HUD rebuilds, and indexing are now gated and deduplicated; idle CPU and "Using Significant Energy" pressure are sharply reduced.

### Improvements
- Session list: row rendering diet — shared date formatting, precomputed pills, and memoized project names keep scrolling smooth at large row counts.
- Transcript: live-tail rebuilds are throttled while the app is inactive and catch up instantly on activation.

### Bug Fixes
- Transcript: Antigravity and GitHub Copilot sessions now render inline images that were previously detected but never displayed.
- Session list: toggling "Hide zero-message sessions", "Hide low-message sessions", or housekeeping visibility now refreshes OpenClaw and Antigravity results immediately instead of waiting for an unrelated refresh.
- Session list: archived-pill behavior is pinned for switch-branch Claude Desktop sessions.
- Quota Meter: the Session Runway overflow label now always reads "+N sessions" instead of splitting into burn/idle "bursts".

## [4.0] - 2026-06-28
### Highlights
- **Quota Meter — now with Session Runway.** See at a glance how much of your Codex and Claude 5h and weekly limits is left and when it resets. New in 4.0, **Session Runway** adds live per-session burn-rate bars, so you can spot which active session is eating your quota fastest before it costs you the window. (Formerly "Limits Cockpit.")
- **Codex Side Chats** — recover Codex Desktop side chats as searchable rows with a distinct `side` badge and parent context; filter with `#side` (and `#side phrase`), and Copy Session ID copies the parent thread ID.
- **Antigravity provider** (replaces Gemini CLI) — discovers Antigravity CLI session transcripts, resumes via `agy --conversation <id>` (with `--continue` fallback), tracks live sessions, and shows local screenshots in the transcript and image browser.
- **Restore archived Claude sessions** — Agent Sessions surfaces archived Claude Code sessions (an `archived` pill and an archived-only filter) and restores them in place, within its searchable local history. Because the app is otherwise read-only, restore is an explicit opt-in that's off by default — Agent Sessions only writes to Claude's files once you enable it.
- **Claude dynamic workflows** — Claude Code's Workflow tool spawns subagents dynamically at runtime; those workflow subagents now nest under the session that launched them with a `workflow` badge and a fan-out marker on the parent, instead of cluttering the list as standalone rows.

### Features
- **Codex reset credits** — when Codex grants a free "reset your usage now" credit, the Quota Meter and menu bar now surface it and show when it expires, so you can see how many resets you have banked and how long they last.
- **Transcript identity strip** — a compact strip showing session identity, `side`/`sub` labels, and parent context, so the transcript stays identifiable even when the session list loses focus.

### Bug Fixes
- Unified Window: fixed hangs on large Codex histories — the session list no longer stalls diffing full transcript payloads, the Project column no longer re-parses raw transcript JSON during layout, and returning to the app caches hierarchy state instead of rebuilding it.
- Claude usage: OAuth/Web refreshes now preserve a recent hard-probe 5h limit and reset time when the soft snapshot only reports weekly quota.
- Claude usage: projected-exhaustion alerts now use fractional usage, so small real burns are not missed.
- Claude usage: Claude Code 2.x `/usage` quota gaps and rate-limit responses are treated as unavailable data instead of false 0% readings.
- Claude usage: hard refresh now finds Homebrew `tmux` from GUI launches, stale credentials point to `claude /login`, and built-in `~/.local` updater installs are recognized by the per-agent update action.

### Improvements
- Quota Meter: moved the cockpit-display settings (5h run-out projection token, Session Runway text size) to the Agent Cockpit Settings tab.
- Quota Meter: removed the active/idle session color dots and counters from the header; the All/active/idle filter pills remain in the Full and Compact cockpit views.
- Quota Meter: added toolbar Runway/view controls and a Standard / Enlarged size option.
- Session list: the Claude agent filter is now a segmented pill matching Codex, and Claude Desktop rows show their Desktop session name.
- Unified Window: collapsed hierarchy state now persists across relaunches.
- Website: replaced the GitHub Pages landing page with the redesigned product page (updated Antigravity positioning, Quota Meter copy, and production download metadata).
- Agent-format maintenance: re-verified all supported session formats against current CLI builds (Codex, Claude, Antigravity, Copilot, OpenCode, Hermes, OpenClaw, Cursor, Pi) and updated parser/format coverage where formats changed.

## [3.9.3] - 2026-06-12
- Transcript toolbar: Markdown export now writes embedded session images into a sibling assets folder and references image attachments so exported transcripts keep visible images.
- Transcript toolbar: Markdown export now creates a human-readable document with session metadata, role sections, and collapsible tool details instead of dumping terminal/UI formatting.
- Transcript toolbar: Export now writes the selected session transcript in terminal mode instead of saving an empty Markdown file.
- Dock: Hide Dock icon can now rely on a pinned Agent Cockpit as the app's reopen path, so hiding the Dock no longer forces the menu bar item on when Cockpit is pinned.
- Quota Meter: 5h run-out tokens now expire based on the last actual burn observation rather than passive refreshes, hide when the 5h reset will arrive before the projected run-out, Claude projections use fractional usage changes when available, Cockpit auto-expands when width fallback would otherwise hide an active projection, run-out tokens are easier to read in the Cockpit, and Limit Alerts diagnostics now show the current 5h projection and notification delivery state without leaving stale active ETAs behind.
- Settings: Standardized visible app copy on Settings instead of mixing Settings and Preferences labels.
- Limit Alerts: Low-limit and projected-runout notifications now share one clearer message with percent remaining, fresh burn ETA when available, and reset timing, while Settings shows a plain readiness verdict before detailed diagnostics.

## [3.9.2] - 2026-06-10
### Improvements
- Limit Alerts and Predictions: Added freshness-aware Codex and Claude run-out predictions, earlier Cockpit ETA markers, and separate notification controls for predicted exhaustion versus low-threshold warnings.
- Onboarding: Replaced the Agent Cockpit slide in fresh-install and update tours with a Quota Meter slide covering prediction markers and Limit Alerts.
- Quota Meter: Refreshes visible Codex and Claude non-tmux usage sources every 60 seconds, keeps Claude OAuth/Web cache and retry freshness within a 3-minute ceiling, repaints reset countdowns without requiring hover, shows a compact 5h projected run-out token in Cockpit, and warns with an ETA when fresh usage burn rate projects a limit exhaustion before reset.
- Quota Meter: Cockpit 5h run-out tokens now show fresh before-reset ETAs beyond the last-hour alert window, so visible usage velocity can surface earlier than notification warnings.
- Limit Alerts: Added a dedicated Preferences pane with source/freshness diagnostics, split predicted run-out alerts from low-threshold alerts, and gates prediction on fresh usage data while ignoring stale snapshots.
- Dock: Added a Hide Dock Icon command to the Dock tile right-click menu.
- Menu bar: Turning off the menu bar item now stays off across relaunches by clearing Hide Dock icon instead of letting the safety path re-enable the menu bar.

## [3.9.1] - 2026-06-05
### Bug Fixes
- Menu bar: Kept the live status label visible instead of collapsing it to a generic stack icon when usage or session counts exceed a narrow width threshold.
- Menu bar: Hide Dock icon now launches as a UIElement-capable app and clears stale Dock recent-app entries when switching hidden, preventing macOS from leaving a visible Dock icon behind.

## [3.9] - 2026-06-04
### Features
- Quota Meter: Added a small always-on Codex and Claude usage window for MacBook users who want 5h and weekly limit visibility without spending menu bar space or opening the full Agent Cockpit.
- Usage Tracking: Added shared Codex and Claude limit notifications for approaching or exhausted 5h and weekly limits, with per-provider and per-warning controls plus a 5h reset alert.
- Unified Window: Added View menu commands to collapse or expand all visible session hierarchy groups.
- Unified Window: Added a persistent Transcript Window toggle so the transcript pane can be hidden for list-focused browsing.

### Improvements
- Quota Meter: Shows Codex and Claude on separate rows, adapts reset times to the available width, and keeps controls out of the way until hover.
- Menu bar: Restored the Dock icon automatically when Hide Dock icon is enabled but macOS cannot fit the menu bar item, keeping the app reachable.
- Unified Window: Added a Saved-only suffix to the session count when the saved-session filter is active.
- Agent formats: Preserved empty Hermes session metadata records during parsing and added explicit compatibility verdicts to agent-support monitoring reports.
- Agent formats: Added real-session prebump drivers for OpenCode, OpenClaw, Cursor, and Hermes, and refreshed verified coverage for the 2026-06-02 Codex, Claude, Copilot, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Cursor, Hermes, and Pi binaries.
- Agent formats: Added an official Cursor CLI latest-version source and expanded Cursor Desktop agent-window monitoring with fresh chat metadata evidence.
- Agent formats: Refreshed Claude 2.1.161, Gemini 0.45.0, and Copilot 1.0.59 format coverage from fresh real-session probes.

### Bug Fixes
- Unified Window: Fixed session-list scroll position jumping back to the top during live-session refreshes.
- Unified Window: Kept Collapse All and Expand All scoped to visible hierarchy groups and preserved the parent selection when a selected child row is collapsed.

## [3.8.2] - 2026-05-28
- Agent formats: Added Hermes 0.15 state database support, Pi prebump validation, OpenClaw trajectory-file exclusion, and refreshed verified format coverage for current Codex, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Hermes, and Pi binaries.
- Session list: Fixed the toolbar Saved filter so it toggles saved-only sessions even when the Save column is hidden.
- Image Browser: Fixed a crash when opening from the menu bar while multiple enabled agents expose the same raw session ID.

## [3.8.1] - 2026-05-27
### Highlights
- Resume workflows can now open every supported CLI agent in Warp or WarpPreview, using Warp terminal tab configs for new tabs.
- Terminal selection is now shared across agents, dynamically shows installed terminal apps, and migrates older per-agent iTerm preferences.

## [3.8] - 2026-05-12
### Features
- Agent Sessions is no longer just for CLI agents: Codex Desktop and Claude Desktop sessions now sit more naturally beside CLI histories, making the app a stronger hub for browsing, filtering, and identifying sessions regardless of whether they came from the terminal or a native desktop app.
- Pi CLI agent: Added tier-2 local support for Pi JSONL sessions under `~/.pi/agent/sessions`, including discovery, browsing, search, Preferences controls, Pi accent colors, and Resume/Copy Resume commands via `pi --session`; Agent Cockpit/live status, analytics, and usage tracking remain unsupported.

### Bug Fixes
- Session list: Archived Codex Desktop filtering now supports archived-only browsing and keeps archived Desktop rows visually distinct on the existing `desk` pill.
- Session list: Codex Desktop and Claude Desktop projectless chats now show `Codex Desktop Chats` and `Claude Desktop Chats` for easier filtering and identification.
- Session list: Codex Desktop and Claude Desktop worktree sessions now keep the parent project name while showing the worktree as a subtle second line.
- Session list: Codex Desktop worktree rows now recover parent project names from explicit git origin metadata instead of deriving them from matching worktree name prefixes, and remain compatible with older Codex state database schemas that do not yet include git origin columns.
- Sessions/Search: Restored Codex Desktop sessions with old rollout dates now sort by fresh activity, are picked up when their files change, and remain searchable even before full-text indexing has warmed or when only non-large transcripts are available.
- Analytics: Chart coloring now derives from the actual enabled agent data, preventing mismatches or crashes when newer providers appear in the dataset.

### Improvements
- Menu bar: Added Show/Hide Dock Icon and Quit commands, with a separator before Quit and safer Dock/menu-bar preference synchronization.
- Preferences: Moved About above the agent-specific panes in the sidebar so product details stay grouped with general app settings.

## [3.7.1] - 2026-05-01
### Bug Fixes
- Claude: Standard `~/.claude` transcripts launched from Claude Desktop now persist Desktop origin metadata and show the `desk` pill instead of the CLI pill.
- Session list: Claude Desktop rows keep the `desk` pill even when cached rows have not yet hydrated generic surface metadata.

## [3.7] - 2026-05-01
### Features
- Claude: Desktop local-agent transcripts under Claude's Application Support directory are now discovered, enriched with Desktop metadata, and shown with the `desk` surface pill.

### Improvements
- Session list: Claude rows now use the same Agent-column `cli` and `desk` surface pills as Codex rows.
- Indexing: Session origin metadata now has generic originator/source/surface fields so non-Codex providers can use desktop or IDE surface labels without reusing Codex-specific columns.

## [3.6.7] - 2026-04-29
### Bug Fixes
- Menu bar: Preferences changes now update the status item immediately without requiring relaunch.
- Session view: Reduced first-click transcript loading stalls by avoiding duplicate selected-session parses, deferring nonessential transcript cache/inline-image/probe work, and cutting synchronous terminal linkification work during first paint.

### Features
- Transcripts: JSON-style tool outputs now render simple results, entries, files, grouped search matches, accessibility trees, error envelopes, suggestions, and trailing hints as readable transcript text instead of raw pretty-printed JSON.
- Onboarding: Update tours now start with a random pair of Power Tips, fresh-install onboarding keeps the two highest-value tips with a full-tour link, and Help includes a Power Tips item for reopening the multi-slide tips tour.
- Gemini: Added support for Gemini CLI 0.40 JSONL session files under `~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/chats/session-*.jsonl`.
- Session view: Added a floating top up-arrow that jumps directly to the first real user prompt.

### Improvements
- Menu bar: Agent Cockpit and Agent Sessions commands now switch between Open and Hide based on window visibility.
- Session view: User prompt blocks now use a softer gray background in light mode while preserving the previous prompt text color.
- Session list: Archived Codex Desktop sessions now show the existing `desk` surface pill in italic.
- Claude: Generated `ai-title` metadata now improves Sessions-list titles when no explicit `/rename` title exists.
- Monitoring: Added Hermes session-format checks for `~/.hermes/sessions/session_*.json` and removed Droid from the active monitoring set.
- Monitoring: Updated agent format checks for Claude 2.1.123 metadata, Gemini 0.40 JSONL sessions, Copilot 1.0.39 `system.message`, OpenCode 1.14.29, and OpenClaw 2026.4.26.

## [3.6.6] - 2026-04-29
- Onboarding: Update tours now start with a random pair of Power Tips, fresh-install onboarding keeps the two highest-value tips with a full-tour link, and Help includes a Power Tips item for reopening the multi-slide tips tour.
- Onboarding: Added a Power Tips slide for update and fresh-install tours, highlighting Hide Dock icon and Agent Cockpit.
- Session list: Archived Codex Desktop sessions now show the existing `desk` surface pill in italic.
- Claude: Generated `ai-title` metadata now improves Sessions-list titles when no explicit `/rename` title exists.
- Monitoring: Added Hermes session-format checks for `~/.hermes/sessions/session_*.json` and removed Droid from the active monitoring set.
- Gemini: Added support for Gemini CLI 0.40 JSONL session files under `~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/chats/session-*.jsonl`.
- Monitoring: Updated agent format checks for Claude 2.1.123 metadata, Gemini 0.40 JSONL sessions, Copilot 1.0.39 `system.message`, OpenCode 1.14.29, and OpenClaw 2026.4.26.
- Session view: Added a floating top up-arrow that jumps directly to the first real user prompt.
- Session view: User prompt blocks now use a softer gray background in light mode while preserving the previous prompt text color.
- Transcripts: JSON-style tool outputs now render simple results, entries, files, grouped search matches, accessibility trees, error envelopes, suggestions, and trailing hints as readable transcript text instead of raw pretty-printed JSON.
- Session view: Reduced first-click transcript loading stalls by avoiding duplicate selected-session parses, deferring nonessential transcript cache/inline-image/probe work, and cutting synchronous terminal linkification work during first paint.

## [3.6.5] - 2026-04-28
- Indexing: Launch and manual session refreshes now use the interactive indexing profile instead of the active-window capped profile, avoiding slow full catch-up scans after an index reset.
- Codex: Subagent session pills now show provider-reported reasoning effort in their hover tooltip when Codex records `turn_context.payload.effort`.
- Crash Reports: Improved `.ips` parsing so pretty-printed macOS diagnostic payloads include exception details, timestamps, and top frames in exported reports.
- Codex: Fixed Resume in Terminal by keeping the launched command as plain `codex resume`; Cockpit live tracking remains handled by independent process/iTerm discovery instead of a resume-command wrapper.
- Codex: VS Code-surface sessions no longer offer Codex CLI resume commands when they cannot hydrate useful CLI content.
- Codex: Desktop-originated Codex subagent rows now keep the `desk` Agent-column badge while showing the subagent marker in the session title.

## [3.6.4] - 2026-04-27
- Codex: Local rollout sessions from Codex CLI, Codex Desktop, and the Codex VS Code extension now stay in one Codex corpus with row-level surface labels.
- Codex: Session titles can now fall back to the local Codex `state_*.sqlite` thread metadata when `session_index.jsonl` has no rename.

## [3.6.3] - 2026-04-24
- Preferences: Removed Droid from the Settings sidebar as part of the ongoing provider de-emphasis, while keeping legacy Droid session support available.
- Session list: Updated Hermes and OpenClaw accent colors to separate them more clearly from Claude in agent-name styling.
- Hermes: Added local Hermes session discovery, transcript browsing, analytics inclusion, and resume/copy-resume actions in Unified Sessions.
- Hermes: Fixed local session decoding and Unified search/filter integration so newly enabled Hermes sessions appear in Unified, search deeply by transcript text, retain meaningful titles for long prompts, and copy the correct resume ID.
- Hermes: Hermes sessions now preserve recorded `cwd` metadata for search/path filtering without probing the filesystem during indexing.
- Hermes: The Project column now shows the session origin from Hermes `platform` metadata, such as `cli`, `telegram`, or `cron`.
- OpenClaw: The Project column now shows derived session origin, such as `telegram`, `cron`, or `tui`.
- Session list: Subagent fallback markers now appear in the Session column instead of the CLI Agent column, so unresolved subagents no longer read as `s Codex`, `s Claude`, or `s OpenCode`.

## [3.6.2] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- OpenCode: Renamed session titles (set via `/rename`) are now persisted as custom session titles, matching Claude and Codex behavior.

### Fixed
- Session list hierarchy now nests older Codex role subagent sessions that record only `source.subagent` when a same-workspace parent can be inferred, even after multi-hour gaps.
- Resume launch AppleScript now receives commands via `osascript` argv instead of source interpolation, reducing script-injection surface.
- Transcript rendering now uses a bounded transcript cache and preloads Whole Session Raw/Pretty content outside `body` to reduce memory spikes and UI stutter on large sessions.
- Claude OAuth shared cache writes now apply restrictive POSIX permissions on cache directory and files.
- IndexDB bootstrap now configures `busy_timeout` and runs schema/bootstrap migration steps inside a single transaction for safer concurrent startup.

## [3.6.1] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Cursor resume: Unified Sessions now supports launching Cursor CLI resume directly with automatic `--continue` fallback, plus Copy Resume Command support for Cursor sessions.
- OpenClaw: Deleted sessions now shown by default with a badge indicating removal.
- Monitoring: Fresh-session validator v1 — detects and flags staleness traps in the weekly agent_watch dispatch.

### Fixed
- OpenClaw: Eliminated full-rescan on every app launch; incremental refresh now used consistently.
- Monitoring: Excluded OpenClaw backup paths from weekly probe to avoid false positives.
- Cursor: Guarded against non-string role values in schema fingerprinting to prevent crashes on unexpected transcript shapes.
- Monitoring: Removed spurious `exit_code` field from stdout in the no-db-found path.

### Maintenance
- Droid support deprecated; histories remain importable for legacy use.
- Cursor added to agent_watch weekly monitoring with SQLite probe and schema fingerprinting.
- Agent version bumps: Claude 2.1.104, Copilot 1.0.24, OpenClaw 2026.4.10.

## [3.6] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- Cursor: Cursor CLI sessions added as 8th session provider — imports JSONL agent transcripts and SQLite chat databases from `~/.cursor/`. Supports session browsing, search, transcript viewing, subagent hierarchy, and resume command. No Cockpit support in this release.
- Discoverability: New-provider detection banner appears in the sessions view when a newly supported agent is found on disk but not yet enabled, prompting users to turn it on.
- Onboarding: Update tour now auto-generates a slide for newly available providers, so users see what's new without digging into preferences.
- Session sources: `versionIntroduced` and `featureDescription` metadata added to session source model for use in discoverability and onboarding flows.

### Fixed
- Cursor: Subagent metadata (`parentSessionID`, `subagentType`) now preserved during CursorSessionIndexer session merges.
- Reliability: Replaced unbounded `waitUntilExit` with bounded `Process.waitForExit` across CLI integrations (Codex, Gemini, Preferences), preventing potential hangs on unresponsive child processes.

### Maintenance
- Schema drift fixtures updated for Copilot `session.shutdown` and Claude `attachment` event types.
- Agent support matrix bumped for weekly format checks (2026-04-06).
- OpenCode fixture version bumped to 1.3.17.

## [3.5] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- Transcript toolbar: Export as Markdown button for saving session transcripts as `.md` files.

### Fixed
- Analytics: Index now auto-builds on view appear; suppressed probe cleanup double-refresh.
- Concurrency: Captured mutable vars as `let` before `MainActor.run` for Swift 6 strict concurrency compliance.
- Unified view: Restored `@ObservedObject` for Gemini indexer in `UnifiedSessionsView`.
- Thread safety: Added `NSLock` around cached date formatters in `ClaudeSessionParser` and `SessionIndexer`.
- Image Browser: Inline image click now handled in `mouseDown` for reliable open behavior.
- Preview.app: Use `/usr/bin/open` instead of `NSWorkspace` API to launch Preview reliably.

### Performance
- Analytics: Index building now derives from `session_meta` instead of file parsing, significantly reducing work.
- SwiftUI: Eliminated redundant body evaluations and cached date formatters to reduce CPU usage.

## [3.4.1] - 2026-04-03

### Changed
- Analytics: Index building is now explicit and on-demand. Opening Analytics no longer auto-starts indexing from the Unified toolbar; users can start, cancel, and manually update analytics index builds from the Analytics window.
- Performance: Analytics indexing work is decoupled from routine provider refresh paths so Unified/Cockpit stay responsive when Analytics is idle.
- Performance: Core session indexing now uses a lower-impact foreground execution profile, reduced focused-session monitor cadence, and no longer cancels in-flight refreshes when the app deactivates.
- Unified toolbar: Refresh indicator now explicitly represents core session indexing (not analytics), with clearer status/help copy to distinguish it from Analytics index builds.
- Performance: Automatic core refresh monitors now pause while the app is foreground/active and resume in background, reducing sustained CPU and avoiding near-continuous “indexing” status during active Unified use.
- Unified footer: Core indexing status now shows live session progress (`X/Y` and `%`) instead of a generic “refreshing” message.
- Unified filters: Toggling agent pills in the toolbar is now filter-only and no longer auto-triggers index refreshes.
- Indexing UX: Background monitor refreshes now surface as lightweight syncing status, while launch/manual indexing keeps stable progress messaging.
- Indexing reliability: Core indexers now persist their own per-source file-stat baselines and restore them on startup, preventing large false re-sync runs after restart when only a few sessions changed.
- Indexing reliability (Codex): Incremental refresh now force-includes recent files that exist on disk but are missing from the hydrated session snapshot, preventing newest sessions from being silently skipped when persisted file-stat baselines are ahead of session rows.
- Indexing reliability (Codex): `thread_name` side-channel overrides now apply only to verified `.../sessions` layouts and use stronger cache invalidation, preventing cross-root title mismatches and stale rename reuse.
- Agent Cockpit: `Go to Session` remains blocked for cwd-only fallback matches, but runtime-ID matches are now treated as navigable again.

### Added
- Analytics: Build lifecycle UI now includes not-built, building, canceled, failed, and stale states with visible progress details (percent, sessions processed, source progress, and indexed date span).
- Session list: Subagent sessions now show an `s` indicator in flat list view so they are identifiable without the hierarchy expanded. The indicator is hidden in hierarchy view where nesting already conveys subagent status.
- Agent Cockpit: Quota Meter now auto-expands the detail panel when any quota indicator is amber/red and reset times no longer fit inline, so constrained usage is always visible without a hover.
- Codex: Session custom titles are now parsed from `session_index.jsonl` (`thread_name` field) using a lock-protected mtime/size/path cache and tail-read for large files.
- Copilot: Session custom titles are now parsed from `workspace.yaml` (`name` field), gated to directory-based layouts to prevent cross-session contamination.
- OpenCode: Stored session titles, including names set with `/rename`, now populate custom session titles for SQLite and JSON-backed sessions.
- Claude: Custom session titles set via the `/rename` CLI command are now reliably restored after relaunch.

### Fixed
- Claude: Custom session titles set via the `/rename` CLI command were not restored after relaunch because `upsertSessionMetaCore` omitted `custom_title` from its `UPDATE SET`; non-NULL parsed values now update the DB while NULL preserves the existing title.
- Custom title scan in the lightweight parser now uses a chunked gap scan (64KB chunks, 8MB budget) so title records in the middle of large session files are no longer missed.

## [3.4] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- Session list: Codex subagent sessions now appear as nested children under their parent in the unified session list. A toggle shows or hides the hierarchy; `Cmd+H` controls visibility from the keyboard.
- Agent Cockpit: Active Codex subagent count badge added to HUD rows. `Cmd+Shift+S` toggles subagent display.

### Fixed
- Agent Cockpit HUD: Codex active subagent badges now use the runtime `thread_spawn` state DB when available, so open worker agents stay counted even when their rollout files go quiet; passive rollout/`lsof` heuristics remain as a fallback.
- Agent Cockpit HUD: Codex runtime subagent counts now resolve the parent session before runtime edge lookup (even when the primary log path is a child rollout), and runtime state DB discovery now honors `CODEX_HOME`/`SessionsRootOverride` before falling back to `~/.codex`.
- Codex limits tracking: Visible usage surfaces now prefer auth-backed limits refresh first, fall back to CLI RPC and JSONL only when needed, and keep `/status` probing as a last resort. Preferences copy now reflects the new source order.
- Codex limits tracking: `/status` fallback snapshots now refresh their rate-limit buckets correctly, menu-background surfaces still run the preferred OAuth/CLI refresh chain, and partial live responses no longer leave the other bucket frozen as if the whole snapshot were authoritative.
- Performance: Eliminated a `repeatForever` animation CPU drain in session rows that caused sustained energy use even when sessions were idle.
- Security: SQL queries throughout the indexer are now fully parameterized; regex extraction is hardened against malformed input.
- Subagents: Subagent sessions are preserved in search results when hierarchy display is disabled, preventing sessions from going missing in filtered views.
- OpenCode: Parent ID query is guarded for older SQLite schemas that predate the `parent_id` column.
- Indexing: Reindex purge now runs after table creation in bootstrap, preventing failures on first-run with no prior DB.
- Launch/TCC: Session startup now avoids implicit repo filesystem probes while deriving row project names, reducing spurious Photos/Music permission prompts after rebuild/cold launch.
- Launch restore: `Saved Sessions` window now registers shared window-open routing callbacks, so menu-bar `Open Agent Sessions`/cockpit routing still works when only Saved Sessions is restored.
- Launch/TCC: Preferences agent status rows and OpenCode backend badges now use stored non-probing state under build tooling, avoiding extra PATH, root-directory, and SQLite checks during metadata extraction.

## [3.3.3.1] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- Codex: Reset countdown no longer exceeds the 5-hour window — reset times are now stored in ISO 8601 format, preventing a date-rollover bug that produced countdowns of up to 24 hours.

## [3.3.3] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- Agent Cockpit: Reduce transparency is now on by default for improved HUD readability in both docked and floating modes.

### Fixed
- Agent Cockpit: OpenCode sessions now participate in iTerm tab-title enrichment alongside Claude and Codex.
- Agent Cockpit: Hover tooltip columns now align consistently across Claude, Codex, and Copilot providers.
- Codex: Repaired fallback chain for limit tracking when sessions are stale or missing — percentages no longer get stuck.
- Codex: Preserved mtime cache on menu-background alt-source early return, preventing stale timestamps.
- Copilot: Fixed CLI session discovery for subdirectory workspace layouts.

## [3.3.2] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- Resume: Session resume support for GitHub Copilot CLI and Gemini CLI — right-click any active Copilot or Gemini session to copy the exact CLI resume command. Safe to skip this update if you don't use either agent.

## [3.3.1] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- Codex Usage: OAuth API and CLI RPC fallback for rate limits — when the Codex CLI hits a rate limit, usage tracking automatically falls back to the OAuth endpoint so token data keeps flowing without interruption.
- Resume: Copy Resume Command added to the context menu for Claude, Codex, and OpenCode sessions — right-click any active session to copy the exact CLI resume command to the clipboard.
- OpenCode: Session resume support — OpenCode sessions can now be resumed directly from the context menu, matching Claude and Codex.

### Fixed
- **Critical — Codex Usage:** Fixed a 0% token display bug and a blocking-pipe issue that prevented Codex usage tracking from working at all. **This update is required for Codex usage tracking to function correctly.**
- Resume (OpenCode): Corrected OpenCode CLI flags and inherit the user's iTerm preference when generating resume commands.
- Resume (Claude): Fixed Claude session ID resolution so Copy Resume Command produces the correct command for active Claude sessions.

## [3.3] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Claude Usage: Multi-tier tracking with credential gating and Web API fallback. Reads live token usage via the OAuth endpoint (60-second refresh cycle), falls back to the tmux socket probe, and optionally fetches from the claude.ai Web API using a session cookie — with clear Full Disk Access guidance surfaced in Preferences when Web API mode is active.

### Changed
- Claude Usage: Unified the refresh-interval constant across all tracking tiers and hardened org UUID validation to prevent bad identifiers from poisoning the cache across sessions.
- Preferences: Usage Tracking pane layout overhauled — data-source picker converted to a popup menu, segmented controls fill available width without overflow, and strip-option toggles stacked vertically for consistency.

### Fixed
- Usage display: Codex auto-probe cooldown no longer masquerades as UI freshness. Cockpit and in-app usage surfaces now age data correctly after `/status` probes while still suppressing redundant background probes.
- Usage (Codex): Rollout logs that emit `token_count` events with `rate_limits: null` are now treated as limit-unavailable rather than reusing stale session-file percentages from before the last reset. This also re-enables the `/status` probe fallback for that newer Codex session format.
- Agent Cockpit: The pinned HUD limits footer now rebuilds from live usage-model updates the same way the main window footer does, preventing stale percentages from persisting after the underlying snapshot changes.
- Agent Cockpit: Weekly reset times in the hover-expanded limits footer now format consistently as `Day H:MM AM/PM` for both Codex and Claude.
- Agent Cockpit: Cockpit-only launch (including pinned mode) now runs the same one-time startup/bootstrap path as the unified window, so Claude session names resolve without needing the main window open first.
- Claude Usage: Safari cookie path corrected for both sandboxed and legacy macOS filesystem layouts; TCC Full Disk Access guidance now surfaces in Preferences when Web API mode is active.
- Claude Usage: Guarded system-preferences URL construction to eliminate a force-unwrap crash path.
- Claude Usage: Stale OAuth caches are invalidated on 401 responses; 429 rate-limit responses are now routed through the Web API fallback instead of blocking the refresh cycle.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Agent Cockpit HUD: Usage limits footer now shows Claude API reset time and rate-limit state, with idle reason classification surfaced on the status dot.
- Agent Cockpit HUD: Claude OAuth usage tracking with tmux socket fallback for probe-less environments.

### Fixed
- Agent Cockpit HUD: Eliminated transient "—" flash when iTerm2 probe returns an empty result.
- Agent Cockpit: Three probe stability fixes — tmux socket leak on teardown, excessive re-probe on focus change, and HUD visibility loss after backgrounding.
- Agent Cockpit HUD: Three display fixes — stale session titles after tab switch, empty-state flash on first load, and wrong-tab focus on direct open.
- Session discovery: Prevent two processes sharing the same working directory from claiming the same session log.
- Session discovery: Infer Claude session log from project directory when `lsof` socket lookup misses it.
- Session discovery: Assign distinct sessions to multiple presences in the same workspace.
- Session discovery (Claude Code): Improved Cockpit HUD session matching for Claude Code processes.
- Session discovery (Claude Code): Use `fullReconcile` on Cockpit-only launch to surface sessions that skipped the normal indexing path.
- Agent Cockpit HUD: Bootstrap indexers from Cockpit and show a spinner while usage limits are loading.
- Usage probe: Parse ISO 8601 reset timestamps correctly and display reset time even when the limit data is stale.
- Usage probe: Enforce a 5-minute minimum on `429 Retry-After` to prevent rapid retry loops.

## [3.2] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- OpenCode: Added read-only SQLite backend support for OpenCode v1.2+, including automatic detection between `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` and legacy per-file JSON session storage. Preferences → OpenCode now shows the detected backend.

### Changed
- Agent Cockpit / Menu Bar: OpenCode live sessions now participate in shared active/waiting summaries, background session lookup, and iTerm-based presence detection alongside Codex and Claude.

### Fixed
- OpenCode: Main-window session rows now show live-state dots for active and waiting OpenCode sessions.
- OpenCode: iTerm busy-state detection is more reliable, reducing false idle/open classification while a session is still working.
- OpenCode: Search hydration and direct session-directory overrides now work correctly for SQLite-backed storage.
- OpenCode: Raw JSON previews are capped at `8 KB` with valid-JSON truncation to avoid oversized payload rendering.

## [3.1] - 2026-03-12

### Changed
- Onboarding: Session visible/hidden counts now refresh on any live session-data update (not just total-count deltas), and DB snapshot fallback now evaluates session visibility with the same active filter logic used by onboarding counts.
- Window restoration: Relaunch now restores the primary `Agent Sessions` window reliably even when its autosave name was already set, and auto-reopens `Agent Cockpit` when it was pinned.
- Agent Cockpit: Major stability update. Fixed the Cockpit CPU/energy leak, eliminating long-run resource creep while pinned or backgrounded, while also reducing full-list/partial-row flicker and improving handling for disappearing probe rows.
- Agent Cockpit: Follow-up CPU stabilization now suppresses redundant HUD snapshot invalidations, pauses idle-dot pulse animation while the app is inactive, and applies stable-cycle pinned-background cadence backoff up to `5s` to reduce long-run CPU accumulation without changing foreground responsiveness.
- Agent Cockpit: Navigation and pinned-window behavior are more reliable after relaunch and while backgrounded, including correct `Open Agent Sessions` routing and tooltip layering above the HUD.
- Menu Bar: Added a dedicated `Show Active/Waiting sessions` toggle plus a `Show menu bar icons` setting so live session dots can be shown independently from usage meters.
- Preferences: Added an `Advanced` toggle to hide the Dock icon by switching Agent Sessions into accessory app mode; default remains off.
- Preferences: `Hide Dock icon` now keeps a reopen path by auto-enabling the menu bar item, and app activation policy falls back to Dock-visible mode if no persistent reopen affordance is available.
- Menu Bar: `Open Agent Cockpit` now routes by the cockpit window identifier only, avoiding false matches against unrelated untitled windows.
- Agent Cockpit: Non-active live sessions now use `Waiting` terminology, grouped headers stay single-line, compact pinned mode keeps its toolbar visible, and long-waiting projects are visually deprioritized.
- Menu Bar / Agent Cockpit: Live active/waiting counts and quick actions are surfaced more clearly, and follow-up fixes restored hidden menu bar items and unresolved Codex live presences.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Active green live-status dots now render through a strictly static path so they no longer pulse in cockpit rows; idle amber dots remain animated.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Compact mode no longer auto-resizes on every row-count change by default; it now uses a stable default height (`Medium`, 4 rows) with internal scrolling, preserves user-resized compact height when toggling full↔compact and across app restarts, and adds compact-size controls (`Small/Medium/Large`) in Settings plus optional auto-fit re-enable.

## [3.0] - 2026-03-04

### Features
- Agent Cockpit (Beta) is now the primary live command center for active iTerm2 Codex CLI and Claude Code sessions.
- Onboarding was redesigned around cockpit-first workflows so new and upgrading users reach live session controls faster.
- Cockpit gained direct row actions (`Go to Session`, terminal focus, log/workdir reveal, and copy helpers) for quick workflow handoffs.

### Improvements
- Live session tracking now better reflects real activity with clearer active vs idle states and steadier HUD indicators.
- Gemini session discovery now supports newer named project folder layouts under `~/.gemini/tmp`, restoring full indexing for recent Gemini CLI data structures.
- Cockpit compact/full behavior, subtitles, sizing, and toolbar ergonomics were refined for faster scanning and less layout churn.

### Bug Fixes
- Claude usage probe CPU spikes were reduced by hardening tmux cleanup/socket-liveness handling and probe lifecycle management.
- Cockpit window behavior is more stable: unpin restore, subtitle retention, ordering consistency, and compact/full transition reliability were fixed.
- Unified session view refresh and live-state joins were hardened to reduce transient empty flashes, ghost rows, and stale live indicators.

### Added
- Agent Cockpit (Beta): Agent Cockpit is now the primary live command center for iTerm2 Codex/Claude sessions, with grouped active/idle visibility and one-click focus workflows.
- Onboarding (v3): New-user onboarding now introduces `Agent Cockpit (Beta)` as the third slide immediately after `Connect Your Agents`.
- Onboarding (v3 updates): Upgrade onboarding is now a focused two-slide flow with an `Agent Cockpit (Beta)` how-it-works explainer followed by a feedback/community-support slide.
- Sessions (Unified): Added an Agent Cockpit toolbar icon button in the main window for one-click access to the cockpit window.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Added a row context menu with `Go to Session`, `Focus in iTerm2`, `Reveal Log`, `Open Working Directory`, `Copy Session ID`, `Copy Tab Title`, and `Copy Working Directory Path`.
- Cockpit: Added a Cockpit window for active Codex sessions with iTerm2 focus, plus active-session indicators in the Unified sessions list.
- Sessions (Cockpit/Unified): Live session detection now includes Claude in addition to Codex, with mixed-source live rows in Cockpit and source-aware live filtering in Unified Sessions.
- Sessions (Unified): Added a small active-status dot in the `CLI Agent` column for live Codex sessions.
- Sessions (Unified): Added a blue-dot toolbar filter toggle (dot-only control) before the agent toggles to show only active sessions in the list.
- Sessions (Cockpit/Unified): Codex live-session status now distinguishes `active` (working) from `open` (idle). Active rows use a pulsing dot and open rows use a solid dot.
- Sessions (Cockpit): Added a live-session filter segmented control with `Both`, `Active`, and `Open`; default is `Both`.
- Sessions (Unified): Added `CLI Agent` cell double-click terminal focusing in the Sessions list (same focus path as `Focus in iTerm2`), with explicit alert feedback when no focusable live terminal is available.

### Fixed
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Full-mode subtitles now prefer custom iTerm window titles when session naming is set to default job labels (for example `codex`), so configured window-label subtitles are no longer dropped.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Unpin now reliably restores normal window stacking behavior, cockpit tab subtitles now show only cleaned custom tab/window labels (default CLI suffixes are hidden), and row typography/spacing was tightened so idle titles stay readable in both compact and full modes.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): HUD row status dots now use the same shared renderer as the main Sessions list, so active (green) dots remain steady in both compact and full cockpit modes.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Active green status dots now opt out of parent row animations, preventing perceived pulsing/flicker and keeping cockpit active-dot behavior aligned with the main Sessions list.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Compact mode now includes a dedicated tab/window subtitle column after `Agent`, defaults to a narrower first-run compact width (so session titles truncate earlier), auto-hides compact header controls when unfocused unless the mouse is hovering the cockpit, collapses/expands compact window height with toolbar visibility, balances top/bottom compact spacing for short unfocused lists, and now auto-fits focused compact height to visible sessions up to 10 rows before vertical scrolling.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Grouped compact mode no longer over-shrinks on focus loss; when toolbar hides it now subtracts only header height (not extra row delta), so manually sized grouped views no longer clip bottom rows.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Compact/full toggles now preserve user-resized frame dimensions in both directions, cockpit-visible background probing now remains warm even when unpinned (preventing intermittent `No active sessions` flicker while unfocused), and grouped `Idle` pills now use the same amber palette as idle status dots.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Switching from compact mode back to full mode now reliably restores normal titled-window chrome, including title text and traffic-light controls.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Full-mode iTerm subtitle rows now preserve tab/window title metadata through live-row dedupe so subtitle text no longer disappears unexpectedly.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit/Unified): `Go to Session` navigation from cockpit now auto-reveals hidden target sessions in the main list by relaxing restrictive filters when needed.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit/Unified): `Go to Session` navigation now uses a pending request handoff with retries, preventing dropped navigation when the Agent Sessions window/view is still initializing; auto-reveal now also clears `Saved Only` filtering so non-favorite targets can be selected.
- Agent Cockpit: Removed the in-app `Legacy Cockpit` window scene so only `Agent Cockpit` is available at runtime.
- Agent Cockpit: Full-mode row recency now reflects session write activity (`sessionLogPath`/presence source file mtime) instead of heartbeat timestamps; compact mode hides the recency token.
- Agent Cockpit: Full-mode rows can now show iTerm tab title as an optional muted subtitle under the agent label, with long titles truncated and full text available on hover.
- Agent Cockpit: iTerm subtitle detection now falls back to the iTerm window title when a tab/session title is empty, so full-mode subtitle rows remain informative in minimal-tab setups.
- Agent Cockpit: iTerm subtitle refresh now prioritizes current iTerm tab titles (including post-launch tab-title edits), resolves titles by iTerm session GUID when TTY metadata is missing, keeps subtitle lookup in a single guarded iTerm scan so one inaccessible tab variable does not blank all rows, and avoids refresh stalls from per-session `osascript` loops on large iTerm setups.
- Agent Cockpit: Full-mode subtitle discovery now reads iTerm tab titles through the native tab `title` property, so tab-only custom titles remain visible even when window title is empty.
- Preferences (Agent Cockpit): Added `Show tab subtitle under agent name` for full-mode cockpit rows (default on).
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Idle HUD rows now keep the session display name in the main text column, `Last active ... ago` messaging was moved to a compact elapsed column (for example `16s`), active status dots now render as solid green indicators, and idle status dots now pulse amber with a larger size after 10 minutes idle.
- Sessions (Unified): `CLI Agent` live-state styling now matches Agent Cockpit: active sessions use a solid green dot, idle sessions use a pulsing amber dot that grows slightly after 10 minutes idle, and idle source cells are visually dimmed.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit/Unified): Idle amber status-dot pulses now brighten at peak size (instead of dimming), making animation more visible in both Cockpit and the main Sessions list.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Filter controls now use three single-select pills (`All N`, `Active N`, `Idle N`), with `Active` pill accent in amber and `Idle` pill accent in green for clearer state while preserving compact cockpit styling.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Compact mode now uses chrome-less window styling (no titlebar controls), no longer forces compact height on every refresh, and now sizes compact list height with group/divider layout units to avoid hidden rows.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Grouped compact mode now reserves extra bottom spacing so the last row is not cramped/clipped, and switching from compact back to full mode now preserves the current window size (no automatic full-mode resize).
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Compact window sizing now also recalculates while live mode is disabled and reserves space for the disabled-state callout, preventing compact clipping in the disabled state.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Agent label, project name, and session name row typography/colors now align with the main Session list style (source-accent agent text and monospaced session/project text).
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Agent-column labels now render as plain text (pill removed) and use the same standard Codex/Claude accent colors as the main Sessions list.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Removed persistent row-selection highlighting and removed up/down row navigation; cockpit row actions now use direct mouse clicks plus shortcut jumps (`Cmd+1...9`, `Cmd+0` for row 10).
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Compact mode keeps the filter pills visible in the toolbar, removes the keyboard-shortcut badge column, and tightens compact height math so extra top/bottom blank bands are not reserved around the session rows.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Compact mode no longer reserves a titlebar-sized blank strip above the toolbar; compact rows now start at the top edge of the HUD content area.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Removed the active/idle split divider between rows in compact/full list rendering, and hardened HUD window configurator wiring to remain click-through for controls/rows.
- Preferences: Reordered the Settings sidebar so `Agent Cockpit` appears directly after `General`.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit/Codex live detection): Pinned `Agent Cockpit` now uses a faster background refresh cadence (`3s`), foreground-return iTerm live-state probing now ramps in bounded batches to flatten short CPU spikes, and iTerm session discovery now reuses a single session-list fetch for Codex+Claude.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit/Codex live-state): Codex ambiguous non-prompt iTerm tails now fall back to log-write heuristics (instead of immediately forcing idle), and background iTerm probing is now deferred unless the app is foregrounded or a pinned cockpit is visible.
- Sessions (Gemini): Session discovery now accepts named Gemini project directories under `~/.gemini/tmp` (for example `radio4j`), while still supporting both `chats/session-*.json` and direct `session-*.json` layouts.
- Usage tracking (menu bar): The menu bar quota tracker now shows an in-progress spinner while Codex or Claude usage probes are running, matching the in-app usage strip behavior even when reset indicators are hidden.
- Sessions (Cockpit): Selected-row text/dot colors now switch to selection-aware foreground styling and use the main Sessions-list selection accent/table style, improving readability when a Cockpit row is selected.
- Session view (Unified): Selected transcript rendering now keeps the last non-empty session snapshot when refresh churn briefly republishes lightweight/empty data for the same session ID, preventing flicker/empty transcript flashes during live updates.
- Sessions (Cockpit): Cockpit now hides only low-confidence unresolved live placeholders (missing join keys and fallback identity signals like tty/pid/source/workspace), preventing ghost rows while keeping valid fallback-detected live sessions visible.
- Sessions (Unified/Cockpit): Unified session-list live-status dots now refresh on Codex active-membership updates even when `Active sessions only` is off, keeping active/open indicators aligned with Cockpit state transitions.
- Claude usage probe: Login-shell path and `PATH` resolution now strips injected OSC escape sequences (for example from iTerm2 shell integration), respects custom Claude binary overrides, and hardens tmux startup/trust-prompt handling to avoid false `tmux_not_found` and premature probe failures.
- Claude usage probe: Probe tmux cleanup now removes managed socket files at script exit and classifies socket liveness before issuing tmux commands, eliminating stale-label cleanup churn that caused high sustained CPU when Claude tracking was enabled.
- Cockpit/Sessions (Unified): Active Codex sessions are now joined by Codex internal `session_id` when log-path metadata is unavailable, restoring active indicators and Focus-in-iTerm2 availability.
- Sessions (Unified): `Active-only` filtering now immediately applies during in-flight searches and re-seats selection when the previously selected row drops out of the filtered list.
- Sessions (Unified): Agent toolbar filter pills now show a clear enabled/disabled state in monochrome mode.
- Sessions (Codex active indicators): Active-session path normalization now uses cached canonical (symlink-aware) paths so equivalent roots (for example `/var/...` and `/private/var/...`) still join correctly, process fallback probing now shifts to slower completeness sweeps when registry data is already present, and background polling/probing now backs off while the app is inactive.
- Sessions (Codex active indicators): Active-session polling visibility now tracks Unified/Cockpit consumers per window instance, so closing one of multiple open windows no longer drops refresh cadence for the windows that remain visible.
- Sessions (Codex active indicators): Re-enabling active-session detection now preserves existing visible-window consumer registrations, so polling/probing immediately returns to foreground cadence without requiring window reopen.
- Sessions (Codex active indicators): Active lookups now avoid event-derived session-id fallback on row render paths, codex internal-id hint backfill now progresses in rotating background batches (instead of a fixed small cap), and active-only list rendering skips redundant per-row active checks.
- Sessions (Codex active indicators): iTerm tail classification now ignores stale historical `Worked for` output and only treats near-tail live markers as active; transient iTerm tail-capture failures now default to `open` instead of promoting sessions to false-active via mtime fallback.
- Sessions (Codex active indicators): Cockpit/Unified now reconcile tty-only iTerm fallback presences with existing keyed presences by TTY before publishing rows, preventing duplicate live-session rows in mixed registry/process + iTerm discovery flows.
- Sessions (Cockpit/Unified): Claude/OpenCode command fallback detection now matches executable command positions only (argv0/wrapper target/shell `-c` head), preventing argument/path-name false positives from creating phantom live rows.
- Sessions (Unified): Claude/OpenCode live fallback matching now assigns up to `N` newest candidate sessions for `N` unresolved presences (workspace-scoped or source-scoped), so concurrent same-repo terminals stay visible in live dots and `Live sessions only`.
- Sessions (Unified): Claude/OpenCode fallback ranking now excludes sessions already directly joined by `sessionId`/log path, preventing mixed direct+fallback states from dropping valid live dots and `Live sessions only` rows.
- Sessions (Unified): Claude/OpenCode fallback presence caching now keys by source + session ID, preventing cross-provider ID collisions from showing incorrect live dots or `Live sessions only` rows.
- Sessions (Cockpit): Unresolved registry-only placeholders are now hidden unless they are focusable or workspace-joinable, preventing ghost sub-agent rows (for example `Active Codex CLI session` with empty project).
- Sessions (Cockpit): Unresolved `subagent` presences are now always suppressed before join-key checks, preventing ghost rows that inherited `session_id` or `session_log_path`.
- Sessions (Claude/OpenCode live-state): iTerm tail probing now remains eligible when a TTY is present even if terminal metadata reports wrappers like `tmux`, reducing false `open` classifications caused by skipped probes.
- Sessions (Cockpit/Codex): Cockpit now hides unresolved Codex placeholders unless they join to an indexed session, preventing Cockpit-only ghost Codex rows while leaving Sessions list behavior unchanged.
- Sessions (Claude/OpenCode live-state): Generic iTerm tail classification now treats strong near-bottom live markers (for example `Esc to interrupt`) as authoritative, while prompt-at-bottom clears only stale/weak markers; weak busy markers are limited to near-bottom output to avoid sticky false-`active` dots.
- Sessions (Claude live-state): Claude now uses a dedicated iTerm-tail classifier and a wider mtime fallback window (`15s`) so active sessions are less likely to be shown as open when terminal output is active but JSONL writes are sparse.
- Sessions (Claude live-state): Claude iTerm probing now uses iTerm session flags (`is processing` / `is at shell prompt`) before tail heuristics, and tail parsing now strips ANSI escape sequences so active markers (for example styled `Esc to interrupt`) are detected reliably.
- Sessions (Cockpit/Claude/OpenCode): Unresolved non-Codex placeholders now require iTerm-backed focus identity (iTerm GUID/reveal URL or iTerm terminal metadata) or workspace joinability; `tmux`/TTY-only unresolved rows are suppressed to prevent Cockpit ghost sessions.
- Sessions (Claude live-state): Claude fallback prompt detection now recognizes zsh-style `%` prompt lines (for example `user@host %`) while still treating percentage status lines (for example `78%`) as non-prompt output.
- Sessions (Claude live-state): Claude probe conflict handling now prefers `is processing` over prompt metadata when both are true, and no-flag tails now classify as `active` only when no prompt markers are present near the bottom.
- Sessions (Cockpit/Claude/OpenCode): Unresolved non-Codex TTY-only rows are now hidden unless they have direct join keys (`session_id`/log path), workspace joinability, or explicit iTerm identity (GUID/reveal URL/`TERM_PROGRAM` iTerm), reducing `tmux` ghost rows.
- Sessions (Claude live-state): Claude tail classification now reserves `active` for strong live markers (for example `Esc to interrupt` / reconnect) so generic lexical history near a prompt does not stick sessions in false-active state.
- Sessions (Claude live-state/Cockpit): TTY-backed Claude rows are now iTerm-attempt eligible even when `TERM_PROGRAM` reports wrappers like `tmux`; Claude tail classification now treats near-bottom weak busy markers as active when no prompt is present, and mtime fallback now uses registry `sourceFilePath` writes when `sessionLogPath` is missing.
- Sessions (Claude live-state): iTerm probe metadata now emits/parses a real tab delimiter for processing/prompt flags, and Claude prompt matching now recognizes `❯ (No obvious next step)` style idle prompts to reduce false-active states.
- Sessions (Cockpit/Claude/OpenCode): Cockpit unresolved fallback assignment now uses the same one-to-one workspace/source mapping as Unified Sessions, so concurrent same-workspace sessions no longer collapse to a single Cockpit row.
- Sessions (Cockpit): Duplicate-row resolution for the same joined session now prefers freshest presence telemetry over stale `active` state, reducing sticky active dots until window reopen.
- Sessions (Unified/Cockpit): Manual refresh now also triggers an immediate live-session probe refresh (bypassing probe throttle), so active/open state transitions update without waiting for background cadence.
- Sessions (Unified): `CLI Agent` live-status cells now rebind on active-membership version changes so active/open dots repaint immediately even when the session row data itself is unchanged.
- Session view (Unified): Session list refresh now holds the prior selection/rows during transient empty publishes while indexing/search churn is in flight, preventing momentary blank transcript placeholder flashes.
- Claude usage probe cleanup: orphaned `as-cc-*` tmux label cleanup is now processed in bounded batches with delayed follow-up passes to avoid large single-pass CPU spikes, and cleanup now excludes the currently active probe label.
- Sessions (Cockpit/Unified/Claude): Cockpit now suppresses unresolved live placeholders that are neither focusable nor joinable to indexed workspace sessions, dedupes unresolved rows by stable tty/workspace identity, and its `Refresh` action now refreshes both live presence and provider indexes; Claude refresh now auto-escalates recent-scope drift to full reconcile, and manual refreshes in both Unified and Cockpit now run Claude full reconcile so newly opened Claude sessions appear reliably in the main Sessions list.

### Changed
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): HUD rows now remove the visible row-number column, keep `⌘1...⌘9` shortcut badges bound to visual order, and apply one-shot highlight washes for newly added rows.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Row order now stays stable while the window is visible and only re-sorts after hide/minimize when membership changed while hidden; quick hide/show without row churn keeps order unchanged.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Compact/full window sizing now persists per mode across restarts, compact defaults to six rows on first use (minimum three rows), and session add/remove no longer auto-resizes the window.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Added explicit empty states (`No active sessions` in full mode, `No sessions` in compact mode) and enabled overflow scroll indicators in compact mode.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit/Unified): Live-status visual hierarchy now emphasizes idle sessions (stronger amber pulse) while active sessions use a calm static green dot; all live dots now render at 7pt and idle row dimming is slightly reduced for readability.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Agent badges, preview text, elapsed-time text, and grouped idle-count chips now use higher-contrast light/dark palettes for improved scanability.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Full and compact HUD modes now both surface vertical scroll indicators for overflow lists.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Full HUD mode now allows long session names to wrap to two lines in the main row text, while compact mode keeps names single-line.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Compact HUD mode now hides the window title text while preserving user-controlled window height.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Replaced the `Agent Cockpit` window UI with the new floating HUD layout (chips, inline filter, grouped mode, compact mode, pin mode, and keyboard row shortcuts) while keeping Legacy Cockpit available and reusing existing live-session backend logic.
- Sessions (Agent Cockpit): Window title now includes the currently shown session count (`Agent Cockpit (N)`), the in-content `AGENT COCKPIT` label and footer row (`Session List` + freshness) were removed, and focused-window blue list focus ring styling was removed for a cleaner HUD appearance.
- Menu/Cockpit windows: Renamed the existing Cockpit window/menu item to `Legacy Cockpit` (defaulting to the `Live` filter), added a new single-instance `Agent Cockpit` window/menu item, moved `⌘⌥⇧C` to `Agent Cockpit`, and removed the Legacy shortcut.
- Menu/Cockpit windows: Removed `Legacy Cockpit` from the `View` menu so only `Agent Cockpit` is exposed in the primary window menu.
- Menu/Cockpit windows: Removed `Legacy Cockpit` from the macOS `Window` menu while keeping the legacy scene code path available.
- Preferences (Advanced): Reordered sections so `Saved Sessions` appears above `Search`.
- Preferences (Advanced): Reordered sections so `Git Context` appears at the bottom, and renamed `Live Sessions + Cockpit` to `Live Sessions + Cockpit BETA`.
- Preferences (Advanced): Live-session/Cockpit controls are now consolidated under `Live Sessions + Cockpit (Beta)` in Settings → Advanced as the single feature toggle location.
- Sessions (Live/Cockpit): OpenCode active/open session detection is temporarily disabled for this release; live-state scope is now Codex + Claude only.
- Cockpit/Sessions (Live controls): When `Live Sessions + Cockpit (Beta)` is disabled, Cockpit and live-filter controls remain visible but disabled with explanatory help text.
- Sessions (Cockpit): Cockpit header controls now show only `Active` and `Live` filters (removed `Cockpit`/`Show` text); `Live` includes both active and idle sessions.
- Sessions (Cockpit): Cockpit window layout no longer uses a fixed content frame; rows scale naturally with window resizing, with per-mode frame persistence and no session-count auto-resize.
- Preferences (Unified Window): Reordered sections so `Columns` and `Filters` appear before `Rich Transcript`.
- Preferences (OpenClaw): Moved `Include deleted OpenClaw sessions` from Advanced to the OpenClaw pane as a standalone checkbox.
- Preferences: Added a dedicated `Agent Cockpit` pane and moved Live Sessions + Cockpit settings there from `Advanced`; compact mode now includes a `Show agent name in compact mode` toggle (default on).
- Sessions (Unified): Removed the leading dot from agent pill toggles in the main toolbar.
- Sessions (Unified): `Active sessions only` now filters to live Codex sessions (`active` + `open`) instead of only actively working sessions.
- Sessions (Unified): `Active sessions only` now filters to live Codex and Claude sessions (`active` + `open`).
- Sessions (Cockpit): Removed `Copy Session ID` from Cockpit row context menus; session ID copy remains available in the Sessions list.
- Sessions (Unified): `CLI Agent` live-status dots now render before the agent name for improved column alignment.
- Cockpit: `View > Cockpit` now always opens/focuses a single Cockpit window instance.

## [2.12] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- Onboarding (updates): Auto-onboarding is now suppressed for upgrades from `2.11.x` to `2.12`; update onboarding continues for users upgrading from older major/minor versions.
- Codex usage tracking: JSONL backward scans now continue extracting token-usage fields while searching for the preferred `codex` rate-limit stream, preventing stale token values when newer non-codex limit buckets are present.
- Sessions (OpenClaw): Tool format scanning now recognizes underscore/case variants for tool-call and tool-result blocks, and `is_error` tool-result flags are now classified as errors in transcript events.
- Transcript (Session view): Code-fence opening detection now requires line-start fences, preventing inline triple-backtick snippets from consuming later fenced blocks and misclassifying narrative text as code.
- Transcript (Session view): Codex review-card parsing now skips malformed fenced JSON candidates and continues scanning later candidates, so one invalid payload block no longer suppresses a valid review summary.
- Transcript (Session view): `path:line:column` file references now preserve their column target when linkified, avoiding overlap with `path:line` parsing that could drop column navigation.
- Transcript (Session view): Opening file links in Cursor/VS Code no longer blocks transcript interaction while the editor CLI starts; CLI launches now run asynchronously with fallback behavior preserved.
- Transcript (Session view): Multiple Cursor/VS Code file-link opens now run concurrently, so slow/unavailable editor CLIs no longer serialize later clicks behind earlier timeout waits.
- Session view (Unified): Jump-to-latest arrow visibility is now driven by transcript position for every agent/session type, so it appears whenever the viewport is away from the end (including immediately after switching sessions) and no longer depends on active-session refresh paths.
- Session view (Unified): The floating jump-to-latest control now uses a smaller compact circle and now appears immediately after session selection whenever the transcript is not at the tail (no initial scroll required).
- Session view (Unified): Clicking the floating jump-to-latest control now hides it immediately after programmatic scroll-to-end, without requiring additional manual up/down scrolling.
- Session view (Unified/Codex): When new output arrives while reading away from the tail, a floating down-arrow now appears in Session/Text modes to jump to the latest transcript output and resume sticky follow-to-bottom behavior.
- Sessions (Unified): Key-window resign no longer clears focused session state, preventing missed active-transcript updates after returning to the app/window.
- Sessions (Unified): Focused active-session monitoring is now capability-driven per source, with one key-window-selected session monitored at high cadence and deterministic stop/start behavior across window/app activation changes.
- Sessions (Gemini/OpenCode/Copilot/Droid/OpenClaw): Focused-session reloads now use in-flight dedupe, unchanged-file fast-skip, and monitor-safe reload behavior that avoids loading-overlay flicker for already-rendered transcripts.
- Session view (Unified): Replaced the table-selection bridge with canonical ID-driven selection so transient row churn no longer clears active transcript selection, and transcript host routing now stays pinned to canonical source resolution.
- Session view (Unified): Active session selection now stays sticky during background refresh/search churn, preventing transient table-selection clears from detaching the transcript pane and showing the empty placeholder while the session still exists.
- Search fields (Unified global search + transcript Find): `Esc` now clears the active field directly when that field has focus, eliminating the system beep and making clear behavior consistent from the keyboard.
- Transcript Find (`Esc`): pressing `Esc` with an empty Find field now closes the Find bar again (`Close Find (⎋)`), restoring keyboard-only close behavior.
- Claude Usage: tmux `/usage` probes now use a larger runtime timeout envelope (derived from script boot timeout) so successful but slower probes no longer fail with premature `Script timed out` (`exitCode 124`) errors.
- Session view (Unified): table selection synchronization now keeps programmatic updates out of manual-selection handling, preventing auto-selection from being disabled by internal selection coalescing.
- Session view (Unified): Removed the transient "Selected session is hidden by the current search/filter" notice and its `Show in List` / `Keep Hidden` actions.
- Session view (Unified): Transcript tail-append now verifies the previous tail event content (not only ID), forcing a full rebuild when a live update rewrites the prior tail event in place.
- Session view (Unified): Transcript view now rebuilds on `eventCount`, `fileSize`, and `endTime` metadata updates for loaded sessions, so in-place live parsing changes without `events.count` growth no longer leave stale text.
- Session view (Unified): Transcript rebuild triggering is now keyed off a stable session render signature (`id`, `eventCount`, `events.count`, `fileSize`, `endTime`, `isFavorite`) so same-ID live updates and favorite toggles always re-evaluate rendering.
- Session view (Unified): Transcript rendering now keeps the last non-empty resolved session snapshot when refresh briefly republishes the same session ID as lightweight/empty, preventing transient blank transcript drops during live refresh.
- Session view (Unified): Transcript tail-append now writes appended output to the in-view build-key cache, preventing stale transcript regressions when switching modes during live updates.
- Session view (Unified): Active transcript tail-append updates now keep readiness state in sync with the current build key, so Unified Search auto-jump still triggers after append-only live updates.
- Session view (Unified): Transcript tail-append now requires render-option parity with the previously rendered buffer, so toggles like `Skip preamble` force a full rebuild instead of appending into stale formatting.
- Session view (Unified): User-triggered manual refreshes now always show loading feedback for the selected session, even when transcript text is already visible.
- Session view (Unified): Loading animation now stays visible when the selected session is still loading but the on-screen transcript buffer belongs to a different session, preventing stale-content flashes without feedback.
- Session view (Unified/Terminal): Loading overlay now remains until the first terminal render completes, preventing brief blank panes and 0/0 navigation states on large sessions.
- Session view (Unified/Terminal): Transcript toolbar semantic navigation now detects code/diff content inside tool-output blocks, and semantic counter totals no longer collapse to `0/0` from semantic-filter state alone.
- Session view (Unified/Terminal): Transcript toolbar now hides navigation chips with no matching items (errors/images/code/diffs/reviews), uses compact marker+count chips when labels cannot fit, and on very narrow widths moves extra chips into a chevron overflow menu.
- Session view (Unified/Terminal): Toolbar fit mode now re-evaluates on width/layout transitions, preventing stale compact/overflow rendering after switching split layouts.
- Session view (Unified): Removed loading spinners from the transcript UI to avoid spinner-on-empty states while sessions load.
- Session view (Unified): Async transcript/JSON renders now persist the originating view mode in render state, preventing transcript-tail append from attaching to buffers built for another mode after mode switches.
- Sessions (Codex/Session view): Active-session transcript updates now append tail content in Session view instead of replacing the full rendered buffer on each monitor refresh, eliminating periodic flicker and preserving in-session reading/navigation context.
- Sessions (Codex): Focused monitor/background refresh reloads no longer surface loading overlays when transcript content is already visible, avoiding repeated loading flashes during near-live tail updates.
- Session view (Unified): Live transcript rendering now applies strict latest-generation gating across async rebuild paths, and Session mode now performs deterministic tail patching/signature checks to reduce stale or flickering text during rapid updates.
- Session view (Unified/Session mode): Terminal find/unified-find auto-scroll now runs only for explicit navigation requests (token-driven) so passive live refreshes no longer yank scroll position; canceled JSON rebuild tasks now reliably clear loading state for the active generation.
- Session view (Unified): Selected transcript content now keeps the last resolved session buffer during transient reindex gaps, and list-side programmatic selection updates are coalesced to avoid table reentrant delegate churn that could leave the transcript pane blank until reselection.
- Session view (Unified): Table-driven transient empty-selection events (during indexing/list churn) now preserve the active session selection instead of treating them as user deselects, and transcript host source/type now stays pinned to the last resolved selected session to prevent blank placeholder fallbacks.
- Sessions (Codex/Claude): Active-session transcripts no longer flash empty during periodic auto-refresh when a lightweight pass temporarily replaces fully parsed session data.
- Stability: Hardened Claude indexing refresh state synchronization (refresh token, file-stat cache, prewarm signatures) and made progress throttling thread-safe to reduce intermittent `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` crashes during concurrent indexing tasks.
- Usage tracking/menu bar: Codex and Claude polling now continues when usage is visible (including active in-app strip visibility), while inactive/background polling remains tied to that specific agent being shown in the menu bar; Codex menu-background polling also now re-seeds to newer JSONL session files instead of stalling on an older file.
- Sessions (Codex): Active selected sessions now refresh tails faster (focused-file monitoring with adaptive 5s/15s cadence), and `Refresh Sessions` now forces a full reload of the selected Codex transcript so newest prompts/outputs appear without reselection.
- Sessions (Claude): Focused selected sessions now use the same focused-file monitor path as Codex, forcing selected-session reloads when the active JSONL changes so live Claude output keeps the transcript pane populated.
- Sessions (Unified/Codex/Claude): Focused-session monitor cadence is now source-aware (Codex faster than Claude) with distinct active/inactive and AC/battery intervals, and monitor interval policy is now defined for every agent source to simplify future focused-monitor support expansion.
- Sessions (Codex): Fixed a forced-reload dedupe race for active-session monitoring so follow-up tail reloads are not skipped when JSONL files change during parsing.
- Startup stability: Hardened launch-time observer/task lifecycle for analytics/onboarding and made updater-controller startup ownership explicit to reduce intermittent launch EXC_BAD_ACCESS crashes.
- Analytics: Kept the analytics-toggle observer active across main-window close/reopen so menu/shortcut toggles continue working for the full app session.
- Sessions (Unified): Closing one window no longer clears shared app-active/focused-session state for other open windows, and closing the last Agent Sessions window now clears shared focus/activity state so background monitor loops stop until a main window reopens; manual Codex refresh intent now survives coalesced refresh execution so selected-session force reload stays consistent.
- Sessions (Unified): Focused-session monitoring now tracks the key window per instance, preventing window-close races from leaving a stale focused session when another main window remains open.
- Crash reporting reliability: Launch recovery now keeps pending crash reports when email/export is canceled or fails, and launch deduplication now tracks all previously handled crash IDs to prevent repeat prompts for old reports.
- Crash reporting reliability: Launch crash scan now checks the full lookback window (not just an early truncated candidate slice), and seen crash-ID history now evicts by recency so recently handled crashes are not re-prompted after history capping.
- Crash reporting reliability: Launch recovery now uses a single queued crash-report model (newest-first), so successful sharing clears only that one pending report and cannot silently drop additional queued items.
- Crash reporting reliability: Crash IDs are now marked seen only when the pending report is actually handled/cleared, and queued report metadata now preserves app version/build from the crash file (not the currently running app).
- Crash reporting reliability: Clearing pending reports now marks every cleared crash ID as seen (not just the latest), preventing re-prompts from legacy or multi-entry pending stores.
- Crash reporting reliability: Seen-ID persistence now happens only after pending clear succeeds; failed/partial clear attempts no longer suppress future crash prompts.

### Changed
- Transcript (Session view): Added semantic transcript rendering for plans, code blocks, diffs, and Codex review summaries, including distinct block accents and improved block grouping boundaries.
- Transcript (Session view): Added clickable local file references (for example `Foo.swift:56`, `Foo.swift#L56`) with configurable editor open behavior (System default, Cursor, VS Code) and optional CLI path override.
- Preferences (Unified Window): Added Rich Transcript controls for review cards, file linkification, code/diff line numbers, and preferred editor target.
- Preferences/About: Added a new Diagnostics section for crash reporting with local pending queue controls (`Email Crash Report`, `Export Report`, `Clear Pending`) and a direct support email link.
- Crash reporting: Crash diagnostics are queued locally on launch and shared only through an explicit pre-filled email draft action; no automatic startup/background upload occurs.
- Crash reporting UX: Crash capture is always on (toggle removed), and when a new crash report is detected at launch the app now prompts to either `Email Crash Report` or `Export + Open GitHub Issue`.

## [2.11.2] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- Startup stability: Prevented a launch-time crash by removing early `NSApp.isActive` reads during Codex/Claude usage model singleton initialization and syncing app-active state after UI startup.

### Changed
- Preferences/Updates: Added an `Auto-Update` checkbox in Settings → About (next to `Check for Updates...`) and enabled Sparkle auto-update by default for new installs while keeping user opt-out.

### Fixed
- Cockpit: Active Codex session detection now keeps mixed registry/probe sessions visible, and Focus in iTerm2 is only enabled when iTerm-targetable metadata is present.

## [2.11.1] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed
- Session view UI polish: Real user prompts now use the same narrative font as other blocks, remove side accent strips, keep inverted contrast in dark mode, and use a dark gray (`white: 0.20`) bubble with white text in light mode.
- Session view UI polish: Removed the synthetic “Conversation starts here” divider line, and the Images toolbar pill now shows icon + count while remaining visible/disabled until images are detected.
- CPU spikes optimization: Global Search now stays on fast indexed results while typing (Return still triggers deep scan), reducing long CPU bursts during active search.

### Performance
- Sessions/Search: Gemini, Copilot, Droid, and OpenClaw indexing now use the same power-aware idle execution profiles as Codex/Claude (lower-priority slices and deferred non-critical work on battery/background).
- Sessions/Search: Global Search no longer generates transcripts on-demand during scans; it searches cached transcripts when available and otherwise falls back to raw event fields to avoid multi-minute CPU bursts.
- Sessions/Indexing: Codex and Claude transcript prewarm runs now cancel previous runs and cap per-refresh work to reduce sustained post-refresh energy spikes.
- Sessions/Indexing: Non-manual refresh work is deferred while the app is inactive and replays on foreground activation to avoid background energy warnings.
- Codex Usage: Automatic tmux `/status` fallback probes now run with stricter stale/no-recent gates, longer cooldown, and lighter file-tail scans to reduce background energy spikes.

### Changed
- Onboarding: Added a visible “Help improve Agent Sessions” feedback card on the first slide (below session/agent counters) that links to the short feedback form and clarifies that Agent Sessions is local-only with no telemetry.
- Onboarding: Fixed overlap in the “Sessions by Agent” weekly chart, split usage limit tracking into separate Claude/Codex cards, and removed onboarding slide scrolling by fitting all slides within the onboarding window.
- Preferences: Added an OpenClaw pane after the other agent panes with Binary Source and Sessions Directory controls, matching the other CLI agent preference sections.
- Preferences: Added a sidebar divider between Droid and OpenClaw, and added per-agent `Update...` actions that detect install manager, check latest versions, and run updates with confirmation.
- Preferences: Improved per-agent `Update...` detection to resolve package-manager binaries from common PATH locations and infer npm package names from the installed binary path (fixes false "manager not detected" and OpenClaw package-name mismatches).

## [2.11] - 2026-02-06

### Major Updates

- OpenClaw sessions: Added OpenClaw (clawdbot) session support, including Advanced visibility for deleted transcripts.

### Major Bug Fixes

- Search completeness: Reduced missing/incomplete search results for some sessions with incremental changed-file indexing, search backfill paths, and stale-row cleanup.
- Energy spikes: Reduced Energy Warning spikes by replacing always-on idle refresh with app-activation/event-driven behavior and power-aware probing/indexing cadence.

### Fixed

- Performance: Removed high-frequency idle background work (Codex warmup loop and archive sync timer) and switched to activation/event-driven refreshes to reduce steady-state battery impact.
- Session view: Removed a QoS inversion path in terminal view cleanup by avoiding lower-priority observer teardown work from interactive code paths.

- Image Browser: Bottom status bar no longer shows “Scanning …” after scanning completes.
- Image Browser: Project scan progress no longer reports “224/224” while the final session is still scanning.
- Image Browser: Project scope now always includes the selected session to avoid missing images when project grouping is incomplete.
- Image Browser: OpenClaw sessions with inline images no longer show “No images” due to a stale cached index.
- OpenClaw: Session view hides the verbose “[media attached: …]” hint text when an inline image payload is present.
- OpenClaw: Tool outputs from `exec` are formatted like other shell outputs and include exit codes when available.
- OpenClaw: Tool outputs that return `{text,type}` block arrays now render as plain text (preserving newlines) instead of showing the wrapper.

### Changed

- Sessions: Added an app-active foreground monitor (60s cadence) for Codex and Claude new-session detection, replacing always-on idle polling.
- Claude Usage: Automatic background `/usage` probes now run only on AC power; on battery and Low Power Mode, refresh is manual-only.
- Codex Usage: Preserved periodic updates while reducing per-tick filesystem/parsing work when source files are unchanged.
- Sessions/Search: Codex and Claude refresh now use incremental changed-file indexing with batched slices, limited worker concurrency, and deferred non-critical work in inactive/battery modes to reduce burst energy spikes.

- Images: Image thumbnails now include a separate “Copy Image Path” action for terminal/CLI pasting.

## [2.10.2] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed

- OpenCode: Auto-detection now works for npm-installed CLIs and checks common pip/pipx install locations on macOS (including `~/Library/Python/*/bin`).
- Filters: “Hide 1–2 message sessions” no longer hides 0-message sessions when “Hide 0-message sessions” is off.
- Onboarding: “Sessions Found” counts now reflect current filter settings; filter labels are now consistently “Hide …”.
- Claude probes: Auto-delete now removes failed/empty probe sessions, not just successful ones.
- Claude probes: Cleanup now requires validated probe evidence (marker or content) before deleting a project, and cleanup messaging is clearer about protecting normal sessions.
- Usage Tracking: Disabling Codex/Claude tracking now also disables their probes/refresh actions and hides them from the menu bar.

### Changed

- Transcript: Tool calls and outputs now render as readable text blocks (commands, paths, stdout, stderr) instead of JSON wrappers.
- Transcript: Tool call/output navigation now groups paired blocks, tool outputs no longer repeat the tool label, and tool/error blocks have consistent padding.
- Layout: New installs default to the vertical split layout.
- Onboarding: The tour now opens in a standard window with a close button.

- Transcript (Session view): Accent strips now sit outside text bounds.
- Transcript (Session view): User prompts use the base system font size with matching left/right accent strips; the system preamble keeps a single left strip.
- Transcript (Session view): Reduced the user prompt Optima font size bump from +2pt to +1pt.
- Preferences (Usage Probes): Moved “Show system probe sessions for debugging” to the bottom of the pane.
- Onboarding: Onboarding counts now use the system font.


## [2.10.1] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed

- Onboarding: Prevent a crash that could occur for some users.

## [2.10] - 2026-01-16

### TL;DR

- Apple Notes-style Unified Search across all sessions and inside a session, compatible with filters.
- SQLite-backed search plus richer instant indexing for faster results and better recall.
- Incremental analytics refresh and faster startup with immediate hydrated lists.
- Session view (formerly Color view) is now a colored timeline with improved formatting.
- Unified Search navigation and local Find are more consistent and responsive.
- Cockpit-style status UI and refreshed session list typography with live counts.
- Onboarding tour refreshed and always shows supported agents.

### Major Changes

- Search: Unified Search is now Apple Notes-style: fast across all sessions, within a specific session, and compatible with all filters.
- Search: Use SQLite full-text indexing to speed up global search after analytics indexing completes.
- Search: Instant search now indexes full tool inputs and outputs for recent sessions (last 90 days), reducing the need to wait for background scanning.
- Search: Tool output indexing now redacts embedded base64/data URL blobs to keep search responsive and the index compact.
- Search: Instant search now uses token-prefix matching by default (for example, `magic` behaves like `magic*`) to improve identifier and structured-text recall without trigram/substr indexing.
- Search: Background scanning of large tool outputs is now opt-in by default, keeping Instant search more responsive (Settings → Advanced).
- Search: Instant indexing now samples long assistant messages and tool inputs (head + middle + tail) to reduce false negatives without indexing the full transcript.
- Search: Instant indexing now captures more of long tool outputs (head + middle + tail slices) and keeps active Codex sessions searchable while they are updating.
- Search: Multi-word Unified Search queries now behave like phrase searches (for example, `exit code`) to match transcript navigation and avoid accidental boolean parsing.
- Search: Unified Search highlights now use token-phrase matching across punctuation/newlines, and Session view reports visible vs total match counts when role filters are active.
- Search: Global search now accepts quoted `repo:` and `path:` filters, and background deep scans run at low priority with on-demand prewarming for opened sessions.
- Search: The Search Sessions menu item and ⌥⌘F shortcut now reliably focus the global search field.
- Search: Unified Search highlights matches in the selected transcript and jumps to the first match when switching sessions.
- Indexing: Analytics refresh is now incremental (skips unchanged files and removes deleted ones) to reduce startup work and keep search data current.
- Startup: When Codex sessions are already indexed, the app now shows the hydrated list immediately while scanning for newly created sessions in the background.
- Transcript: Replace the read-only search box with a Unified Search navigation pill that appears only when Unified Search has a free-text query.
- Transcript: Find in Transcript (⌘F) now opens a local find bar with its own query and navigation.
- Transcript: Unified Search now auto-jumps to the first match after typing or switching sessions, and local Find uses a solid blue current-match marker aligned with the match.
- Transcript: Session view now auto-scrolls to the last user prompt by default, with a Unified Window setting to choose first vs last user prompt.
- Transcript: Color view is now called Session view and presents a colored timeline with improved formatting.
- Transcript (Session view): Use system font for narrative blocks; keep tool call blocks monospaced.
- Transcript (Session view): Blocks now render as rounded cards with subtle tints and left accent borders.
- Transcript (Session view): User prompts now use a thicker accent rail, slightly brighter tint, and semibold first-line text for readability.
- Transcript (Session view): Assistant blocks now use per-agent brand tints and the role legend matches transcript accents.
- Transcript (Session view): Find highlights now mark matched substrings and add a line indicator for easier scanning.
- UI: Consolidate unified-window status indicators into a single cockpit-style footer.
- UI: In dark mode, the cockpit footer now uses a transparent HUD style with crisp borders instead of a solid fill.
- UI: Menu bar usage now uses the same monospace, logo-forward cockpit styling as the footer.
- UI: Persist split-view divider positions per layout mode (horizontal vs vertical) so switching layouts doesn’t reset pane sizes.
- UI: Session list typography now uses monospaced text with softer timestamp gray, taller rows, lighter message counts, and footer-blue selection accents.
- UI: Increase session list row height to 48px for easier scanning.
- UI: Codex now uses a blue brand accent distinct from the cockpit footer tint; the transcript toolbar spacing is tighter, and the terminal view adds a subtle top border.
- Onboarding: Replaced the onboarding flow with a four-slide tour covering sessions, agent enablement, workflow tips, and usage tracking.
- Onboarding: Show all supported agents and discovered sessions in the tour regardless of Sessions toolbar filters; disabled agents appear as inactive.

### Minor Changes

- Onboarding: Refine tour icon and primary button colors to better match native macOS accents.

- Menu Bar: Reset menu items now include weekday; menu bar label can hide reset indicators per provider.
- Menu Bar: Removed pill backgrounds from the menu bar label for a cleaner, more native look.
- Usage: Time-only reset strings now roll forward to the next day to avoid showing stale "<1m" countdowns.
- Transcript: Toolbar controls now use monospaced typography to match the session list.
- Sessions list: Added a context menu action to copy the session ID to the clipboard.
- Sessions: Resume context menu actions now include the selected terminal app (for example, Terminal or iTerm2).

### Critical Fixes

- Search: Prevent missing results while the search index is still warming by falling back to legacy matching for unindexed sessions.
- Search: Backfill missing per-session search data during incremental refresh so sessions don’t remain “not yet indexed” indefinitely.
- Search: Claude sessions now keep transcript match highlights in sync with the active search query.
- Transcript: Remove the ghost control inside the Unified Search navigation pill.
- Transcript (Session view): Match counts now update when Unified Search is active.
- Transcript (Session view): Search markers now appear only on matching wrapped lines and replace the block accent for that line.
- Sessions: Auto-select the first session on launch so the transcript pane isn’t blank.
- Sessions: Stabilize message counts for large sessions while full parsing completes to reduce list row jumps.
- Copilot: Normalize tool output newlines when logs include escaped `\\n` sequences.
- Parsing: Preserve non-zero exit codes in Gemini/OpenCode tool outputs and classify them as errors for error navigation.
- Parsing: Droid stream-json now handles numeric timestamps, tool call IDs, and error flags in tool results.
- Parsing: Treat Claude Code `queue-operation` and `file-history-snapshot` events as metadata so new versions don’t pollute transcripts or inflate message counts.
- Parsing: Gemini sessions now account for `model`/`tokens`/`thoughts` fields in newer chat logs.
- Parsing: Treat Copilot `assistant.turn_start/end`, `tool.execution_start`, and `session.truncation` events as metadata so they don’t clutter transcripts.
- Transcript: Clearing Find now immediately clears match highlights.
- Transcript: Terminal view no longer leaves a stale find highlight when the Find query is empty.
- Transcript: Toolbar filters now use dot + count labels with compact navigation chevrons.
- Transcript (Session view): Render Codex review blocks as labeled Review meta entries instead of user prompts.

- Parsing: Ignore empty JSONL lines during scanning for improved robustness.
- Parsing: Surface Codex thread rollback events with readable text in timelines.
- Claude: Avoid UI stalls when opening sessions with embedded base64 blobs (for example, Chrome MCP screenshots).
- Claude Usage: Detect the Claude Code first-run terms prompt and surface a “Setup required” state instead of timing out silently.
- Toolbar: Keep action icons visible and overflow actions accessible when a project filter is active.
- Toolbar: Refined agent tabs and icon groups, updated the layout/theme controls, and tightened toolbar button sizing and hover states.
- UI: Update Codex and Claude brand accents to blue and warm brown for clearer agent recognition.

- Menu Bar: When usage data is stale, reset indicators now show “n/a” instead of an incorrect countdown.
- Claude Usage: Refresh usage automatically after wake when the usage strip or menu bar label is visible.
- Claude Usage: Keep a timed retry active while Cockpit, footer, or menu usage surfaces are visible after OAuth failures so limits refresh without waiting for a Claude terminal prompt to update credentials.
- Menu Bar: Show an updating spinner next to reset indicators while probes run.
- Search: Unified Search now accepts quoted repo/path filters with spaces.
- Claude/Codex Usage: Add a conservative startup sweep for probe tmux servers and harden cleanup/timeouts to avoid orphaned CLI processes after stalled probes or restarts.

## [2.9.2] - 2026-01-01

### Improvements

- Dates: Normalize timestamps (usage reset times, session dates, analytics labels, and transcript timestamps) to follow system locale and 12/24-hour settings.
- Appearance: Add a toolbar toggle for Dark/Light mode and View menu actions for Toggle Dark/Light and Use System Appearance.
- Preferences: Add quick links to Security & Privacy and License in Settings → About.
- Preferences: Make the Settings → About updates section more compact.
- Preferences: Droid pane now includes binary detection and a version check, consistent with other agents.

## [2.9.1] - 2025-12-29

### Added

- **Droid Support**: Import Droid (Factory CLI) sessions (interactive store and stream-json logs) with a dedicated Preferences pane, toolbar filter, and Analytics support.

### Improvements

- **Color View**: Increased role contrast and added block spacing so user prompts stand out near tool calls.
- **Color View**: Removed bold styling for Codex/Droid preamble blocks so system prompts are visually distinct from real user prompts.
- **Onboarding**: Updated full and update tours to include Droid support and reflect the current agent lineup.

## [2.9] - 2025-12-23

**Agent Sessions 2.9 Christmas Edition**

### New Features

- **Onboarding Tours**: Interactive onboarding for new installs and a skippable update tour for major/minor releases. Reopen anytime from Help → Show Onboarding.
- **Copilot CLI Support**: Full session browser integration for GitHub Copilot CLI sessions. Includes Preferences pane and toolbar filter (⌘5).
- **Saved Sessions Window**: New dedicated window (View menu) for managing archived sessions with delete, reveal, and diagnostics.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Option-Command-Arrow shortcuts to jump between user prompts, tool calls, and errors in transcripts.

### Improvements

- **Preferences**: Reorganized CLI agent controls. Disabling an agent now hides it everywhere (toolbar, Analytics, menu bar) and stops background work.
- **Improved Focus**: Transcript Find controls stay out of Tab navigation unless explicitly opened, preventing stuck focus states.

### Fixed

- **Saved Sessions**: Archive backfill and reveal actions now work reliably. Pinning no longer blocks the UI.
- **Claude Sessions**: Better parsing for modern Claude Code format, session titles, and error detection.
- **OpenCode Sessions**: Fixed missing content in Plain/Color views for migration=2 storage schema.
- **Clipboard**: Fixed intermittent issue where full transcripts could overwrite clipboard.

## [2.8.1] - 2025-11-28

### Critical Fixes

- **Usage Tracking Refresh**: Hard probe actions (Codex strip/menu refresh) now route through hard `/status` probes, preventing older log snapshots from overwriting fresh limits. Stale checks honor hard-probe TTL for accurate freshness indicators.
- **OpenCode Sessions**: User messages now correctly extract from `summary.title` instead of `summary.body`, fixing incorrect assistant responses appearing in user messages for older OpenCode sessions. User messages are never dropped even if empty.

### Added

- **Per-CLI Toolbar Visibility**: New unified-pane toggles in Preferences → General to show/hide Codex, Claude, Gemini, and OpenCode session filters. CLIs automatically hide when unavailable.
- **Usage Display Mode**: New Preferences toggle to switch between "% left" and "% used" display modes across Codex and Claude usage strips and menu bar. Normalizes Claude CLI percent_left semantics for consistency.
- **Preferences → OpenCode**: New dedicated pane for OpenCode CLI configuration including Sessions Directory override to choose custom Claude sessions root (defaults to `~/.claude`).

### Improved

- **Gemini CLI Detection**: Enhanced Gemini binary detection via login-shell PATH fallback, matching other CLI probes. "Auto" detection now reliably finds the `gemini` binary (npm `@google/gemini-cli`).
- **Cleanup UX**: Claude auto-cleanup now shows non-intrusive flash notifications instead of modal dialogs for better user experience.


## [2.8] - 2025-11-27

**My thanks to the OpenCode community - Agent Sessions now supports OpenCode!** (Resume and usage tracking are on the roadmap.)

### Added
- **OpenCode Support**: Full session browser integration with Claude Code OpenCode sessions, including transcript viewing, analytics, and favorites. Sessions appear in the unified list with source filtering.
- Preferences → Claude Code: Sessions Directory override to choose a custom Claude sessions root. The Claude indexer honors this path and refreshes automatically when changed. Defaults to `~/.claude` when unset.
- Preferences → Usage Probes: New dedicated pane consolidating Claude and Codex terminal probe settings (auto-probe, cleanup, and one‑click delete), with clear safety messaging.

### Changed
- Preferences → Usage Tracking: Simplified and HIG‑aligned. Added per‑agent master toggles (Enable Codex tracking, Enable Claude tracking) independent of strip/menu bar visibility. Moved all probe controls into the new Usage Probes pane. Reduced vertical scrolling and clarified refresh interval and strip options.
- Usage Tracking: Separate refresh intervals per agent. Codex offers 1/5/15 minutes (default 5m). Claude offers 3/15/30 minutes (default 15m). Note: Claude `/usage` probes launch Claude Code and may count toward Claude Code usage limits.
- Usage probes run directly on their configured cadence. The legacy `UsageProbeGate` visibility/budget guard has been removed so Claude and Codex refreshers no longer stall after 24 attempts.
- Website: Updated Open Graph and Twitter Card tags to use the `AS-social-media.png` preview so shared links render the large social image correctly.

### Fixed
- Usage Probes: Codex and Claude cleanup actions once again emit status notifications for disabled/unsafe exits and successfully delete Codex probe sessions that log their working directory inside nested payload data.
- Usage (Codex): Stale indicator now reflects the age of the last rate‑limit capture only. Recent UI refreshes or token‑only events no longer mask outdated reset times; the strip/menu will show "Stale data" until fresh `rate_limits` arrive.
- Claude Usage: Added a central probe gate that suppresses `/usage` probes when the menu bar limits are off and the main window isn't visible, or when the screen is inactive (sleep/screensaver/locked).
- Claude Usage Probes: Cleanup now verifies every session file's `cwd/project` matches the dedicated probe working directory, requires tiny (≤5 event) user/assistant-only transcripts, and aborts deletion when uncertain.

## [2.7.1] - 2025-11-26

### Critical Fixes

- **Codex Usage Tracking**: Added full support for new Codex usage backend format. The usage parser now handles both legacy local usage events and the new backend-based usage reporting system, ensuring accurate rate limit tracking across all Codex CLI versions. Automatic fallback to legacy format for older Codex versions.

### Technical

- **Usage Format Migration**: Enhanced `CodexUsageParser` with dual format support to seamlessly transition between Codex usage reporting systems without requiring user intervention or configuration changes.

## [2.7] - 2025-11-23

### Major Features

- **New Color View**: Terminal-inspired view with CLI-style colorized output, role-based filtering (User, Agent, Tools, Errors), and navigation shortcuts. Replaces the old "Terminal" mode with enhanced visual hierarchy and interactive filtering.
- **Enhanced Transcript Modes**: Renamed "Transcript" to "Plain" view for clarity. Added improved JSON viewer with syntax highlighting and better readability for session inspection.
- **View Mode Switching**: Quick toggle between Plain, Color, and JSON views with Cmd+Shift+T keyboard shortcut.

### Critical Fixes

- **Claude Usage Tracking**: Fixed compatibility with Claude Code's new usage format change ("% left" vs "% used"). The usage probe now supports both old and new formats with automatic percentage inversion, ensuring accurate limit tracking across all Claude CLI versions.
- **Script Consolidation**: Unified usage capture scripts via symlink to prevent future divergence. Single source of truth in `AgentSessions/Resources/`.

### Improvements

- **Color View Navigation**: Added role-specific navigation buttons with circular pill styling and tint-aware colors. Jump between user messages, tool calls, or errors with keyboard shortcuts.
- **NSTextView Renderer**: Implemented high-performance text rendering with native macOS text selection and smooth scrolling.
- **JSON View**: Redacted `encrypted_content` fields for cleaner inspection. Improved syntax coloring stability across mode toggles.
- **Debug Mode**: Added `CLAUDE_TUI_DEBUG` environment variable for troubleshooting usage capture issues with raw output dumps.

### Technical

- **Flexible Pattern Matching**: Usage probe now tries multiple patterns ("% left", "% used", "%left", "%used") with fallback to any "N%" format. Future-proofed against CLI format changes.
- **Enhanced Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for both old and new Claude usage formats with validation of percentage inversion logic.

## [2.6.1] - 2025-11-19

### Performance
- Dramatically improved loading and refresh times through optimized session indexing
- Eliminated UI blocking during session updates with background processing
- Reduced indexing contention to prevent launch churn
- Enhanced Analytics dashboard responsiveness for smoother interaction

## [2.5.4] - 2025-11-03

### Fixed
- Sessions: Manual refresh now scans filesystem for new session files even when loading from database cache. Previously, the refresh button would load cached sessions and skip filesystem scan, causing new VSCode Codex sessions to remain invisible until background indexer ran.
- UI: Progress indicator now remains visible throughout entire refresh operation, including transcript processing phase. Previously, the spinner would disappear prematurely while heavy transcript cache generation continued in background, leaving users with unresponsive UI and no feedback.

## [2.5.3] - 2025-11-03

### Fixed
- Release packaging: v2.5.2 tag pointed to wrong commit, missing project filter feature. This release includes all intended 2.5.2 changes.

## [2.5.2] - 2025-11-02

### Added
- Analytics: Project filter dropdown in Analytics window header to drill down into per-project metrics (sessions, messages, duration, time series, agent breakdown, heatmap). Works alongside existing date range and agent filters.

### Fixed
- Analytics: Session counts now match Sessions List by properly applying filter defaults (HideZeroMessageSessions and HideLowMessageSessions both default to true). Previously Analytics counted all sessions including noise (0-2 messages), inflating counts by up to 79%.
- Analytics: Simplified UserDefaults reading in AnalyticsRepository to use consistent pattern with AnalyticsService.
- Analytics: Project filter list now excludes projects with only empty/low-message sessions, matching Sessions List behavior.

## [2.5.1] - 2025-10-31

### Added
- Codex 0.51-0.53 compatibility: Full support for `turn.completed.usage` structure, `reasoning_output_tokens`, and absolute rate-limit reset times
- Usage tooltip: Token breakdown now displays "input (non-cached) + cached + output + reasoning" on hover
- Test fixtures for Codex format evolution (0.50 legacy through 0.53)

### Changed
- Rate limit parsing: Absolute `resets_at`/`reset_at` timestamps (epoch or ISO8601) now preferred over relative calculations
- Token tracking: Added `lastReasoningOutputTokens` field to usage snapshots for extended thinking models

### Fixed
- Backward compatibility: Gracefully handles `info: null` in `token_count` events from older Codex versions
- Parser resilience: Ignores unknown event types (e.g., `raw_item`) without crashing

## [2.5] - 2025-10-30

### Added
- Indexing: SQLite rollups index with per-session daily splits and incremental Refresh. Background indexing runs at utility priority and updates only changed session files.
- Git Inspector (feature-flagged): Adds "Show Git Context" to the Unified Sessions context menu for Codex sessions; opens a non-blocking inspector window with current and historical git context.
- Advanced Analytics: Visualize AI coding patterns with session trends, agent breakdown, time-of-day heatmap, and key metrics via Window → Analytics.

### Fixed
- Usage (Codex): Reset times no longer show "Stale data" when recent `token_count` events are present. Now anchors `resets_in_seconds` to `rate_limits.captured_at` and accepts absolute `resets_at`/`reset_at` fields (including `*_ms`), with flexible timestamp parsing for old/new JSON formats.
- Analytics/Git Inspector: System theme updates immediately; stable session IDs for Claude/Gemini; aligned window theme handling.
- Sessions/Messages totals: Respect HideZeroMessageSessions/HideLowMessageSessions preferences in dashboard cards.
- Avg Session Length: Exclude noise sessions when preferences hide zero/low message sessions.

## [2.4] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- Automatic updates via Sparkle 2 framework with EdDSA signature verification
- "Check for Updates..." button in Preferences > About pane
- Star column toggle in Preferences to show/hide favorites column and filter button

### Changed
- App icon in About pane reduced to 85x85 for better visual balance

## [2.3.2] - 2025-10-15

### Performance
- Interactive filtering now uses cached transcripts only; falls back to raw session fields without generating new transcripts.
- Demoted heavy background work (filtering, indexing, parsing, search orchestration) to `.utility` priority for better cooperativeness.
- Throttled indexing and search progress updates (~10 Hz) and batched large search results to reduce main-thread churn.
- Gated transcript pre-warm during typing bursts, increased interactive filter debounce, and debounced deep search starts when typing rapidly.
- Built large transcripts off the main thread when not cached, applying results on the main thread to avoid beachballs.

### Documentation
- Added `docs/Energy-and-Performance.md` summarizing performance improvements, current energy behavior, and future options.

## [2.3.1] - 2025-10-14

### Fixed
- Search: auto-select first result in Sessions list when none selected; transcript shows immediately without stealing focus.

## [2.3] - 2025-10-14

### Added
- Gemini CLI (read-only, ephemeral) provider:
  - Discovers `~/.gemini/tmp/**/session-*.json` (and common variants)
  - Lists/opens transcripts in the existing viewer (no writes, no resume)
  - Source toggle + unified search (alongside Codex/Claude)
- Favorites (★): inline star per row, context menu Add/Remove, and toolbar “Favorites” filter (AND with search). Persisted via UserDefaults; no schema changes.

### Changed
- Transcript vs Terminal parity across providers; consistent colorization and plain modes
- Persistent window/split positions; improved toolbar spacing

### Fixed
- “Refresh preview” affordance for stale Gemini files; safer staleness detection
- Minor layout/content polish on website (Product Hunt badge alignment)

## [2.2.1] - 2025-10-09

### Changed
- Replace menubar icons with text symbols (CX/CL) for better clarity
- CX for Codex CLI, CL for Claude Code (SF Pro Text Semibold 11pt, -2% tracking)
- Always show prefixes for all source modes
- Revert to monospaced font for metrics (12pt regular)

### Added
- "Resume in [CLI name]" as first menu item in all session context menus
- Dynamic context menu labels based on session source (Codex CLI or Claude Code)
- Dividers after Resume option for better visual separation

### Fixed
- Update loading animation with full product names (Codex CLI, Claude Code, Agent Sessions)

### Removed
- Legacy Window menu items: "Codex Only (Unified)" and "Claude Only (Unified)"
- Unused focusUnified() helper and UnifiedPreset enum

## [2.2] - 2025-10-08

### Performance & Energy

- Configurable usage polling intervals (1/2/3/10 minutes, default 2 minutes)
- Reduced polling when strips/menu bar hidden (1 hour interval vs 5 minutes)
- Energy-aware refresh with longer intervals on battery power

### Fixed
- CLI Agent column sorting now works correctly (using sourceKey keypath)
- Session column sorting verified and working

### UI/UX
